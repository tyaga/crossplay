# Events: one table for every number, and every error

Every service posts what happens, its own and what the devices tell it, to one table on the board
(`events`, `server/board/supabase/migrations/20260903000200_events.sql`).
Mario's "how many people use this" is a view over it; an error posted there
becomes a card on the board by itself, once per distinct problem.

## Posting an event

One HTTP request, no library, the public key, from anything that can reach
the internet:

```
POST https://<project>.supabase.co/rest/v1/events
apikey: <anon key>
Authorization: Bearer <anon key>
Content-Type: application/json
Prefer: return=minimal

{"service":"getbooks","event":"download","device":"<hashed id>","version":"1.12.9","board":"x4pro","props":{"format":"epub","bytes":515054}}
```

The address and the key come from `/api/board-config` on the site or from
`<workspace>/.board/supabase.env`; the pi services get them as environment
variables. The public key can only insert; it cannot read anything back.

| Field     | What goes in it                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `service` | `firmware`, `getbooks`, `anki`, `live`, `site`, `release`, `pulse`, `upstream-sync`, `workflow`. One word, lowercase, the same word every time. The inbox page holds the same list (`site/assets/fleet.js`, `KNOWN_SERVICES`) so a service that has never posted is shown as silent rather than absent; add a word here and there together. A service posting a word this table does not carry is still counted, but it can never be reported as silent.                                    |
| `event`   | What happened: `download`, `search`, `sync`, `install`, `report`, `crash`, `update`, `probe`, `run`. Same rule.                                          |
| `level`   | `info` (default) or `error`.                                                                                                                         |
| `device`  | The id from the device's `X-CrossPlay-Device` header (below): pseudonymous, the same on every request from one device, and not matchable to a MAC without that device's secret. Never the MAC, never a name. A service whose request carried no id may use its own salted hash of an account or token instead, or leave it out. |
| `version` | Firmware version as printed, `1.12.9`. Optional.                                                                                                     |
| `board`   | `x4pro` or `sticky`. Optional.                                                                                                                       |
| `props`   | Anything else, small: a format, a byte count, a duration, a book id. For errors, `message` is required.                                              |

## Errors become cards

An event with `level: "error"` and a `props.message` is fingerprinted: the
service, the event, and the message with every number and hex run replaced
by `#`, so "book 4127 timed out" and "book 9 timed out" are one fingerprint.
A card opens on the board, in `triaged` with the service as its app, when
the fingerprint has been seen three times or on two devices within seven
days: one error from one device is an event, not a bug ("The device has
been lost." was somebody unplugging a cable, and it was a card). The
infrastructure alarms (`release`, `pulse`, `upstream-sync`, `workflow`)
still open at the first one. A card whose error stays quiet for seven days
closes by itself (`board_expire()`, daily). Every later occurrence adds one to the count in
`error_fingerprints` and attaches to the same card. A fingerprint whose card
was closed and that comes back opens a new card: that is a regression.

An `info` event that carries a `fingerprint` says that problem is gone:
the open card for it closes by itself with a "recovered" line. The pulse
does this on every host that answers; a service that can tell its own
error is over may do the same.

Send `props.app` when the card belongs to another app's owner than the
poster (the pulse posts as `pulse`; a dead books host is Get Books').
Send a `fingerprint` yourself when you know better than the message what
makes two errors the same (for example the book id is what matters, not the
timeout).

## What a device sends

A device never makes a request just to report: it never brings the radio up
for the board, and it never spends a request on it. Instead every request
the firmware makes to one of CrossPlay's own services (Get Books, the Anki
bridge, and since the release that carried card
449 the update check, which asks the site's `/api/latest` before it asks
GitHub) carries three headers,
and the service posts what they say alongside the event it was going to
post anyway:

```
User-Agent: CrossPlay-ESP32-1.12.13
X-CrossPlay-Device: 9f2c...64 hex...
X-CrossPlay-Board: x4pro
X-CrossPlay-Report: {"battery_pct":84,"heap_min_kb":112,"uptime_h":31,
                     "crash":{"message":"assert failed: ... (reset: panic)","version":"1.12.12","backtrace":""},
                     "ota":{"attempted":true,"ok":false,"error":"too_large","path":"ota"}}
```

| Header               | What is in it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `User-Agent`         | `CrossPlay-ESP32-<version>`, as it always was. The version is read from here and nowhere else.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `X-CrossPlay-Device` | 64 hex: sha256(MAC + a 16-byte secret the device made once from its hardware RNG and keeps in NVS, namespace `crossplay`, key `hbsecret`). The MAC and the secret are never sent; without the secret the id cannot be matched to a MAC. A flash that erases NVS makes a new secret, so the device comes back as a new id: the site's Install button writes around the NVS partition (card 463; before that every reinstall was a new device), while `esptool erase-flash` by hand still resets it. **A THIRD case makes a second id for one device and is not an erase at all:** when `Preferences::begin("crossplay")` fails, `computeId()` falls back to the fixed salt `kSalt` (`DeviceReport.cpp:123`), so the device reports `sha256(MAC + kSalt)` -- stable, but a different id from its NVS one, and it flips back the moment NVS opens again. A full NVS partition is the way to get there. All three cases are invisible on the board: one reader becomes two ids with nothing saying so, which reads as one device leaving and another arriving. |
| `X-CrossPlay-Board`  | `x4pro` or `sticky`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `X-CrossPlay-Report` | Compact JSON, at most 600 bytes. Always `battery_pct`, `heap_min_kb` (lowest free heap since boot) and `uptime_h` (hours since boot; deep sleep is a boot). While one is pending, `crash` and/or `ota`, below.                                        |

`crash` is the last panic, recorded at the boot after it and carried until a
request delivers it: `message` is the panic reason, `version` the firmware
that crashed (an OTA can land between the panic and the request, so it is
written down at that boot, not read from the User-Agent), `backtrace` the
first stack lines when the chip records any. On `x4pro` and `sticky`
(ESP32-S3, Xtensa) only an assert or abort panic carries a reason, and none
carries a trace: `lib/hal/HalSystem.cpp` writes the reason from
`__wrap_panic_abort` alone. A CPU exception (LoadProhibited,
StoreProhibited, IllegalInstruction) therefore reads `"panic without a
recorded reason (reset: panic; last log: READER)"`, and the reset name plus
the subsystem that logged last are what the fingerprint has to tell two of
them apart. An assert reads `"assert failed: ... (reset: panic)"`.

`ota` is the install attempted since the last report, from the update
screen (`path` `ota`) or from a `.bin` picked off the card (`path` `sd`; a
file refused before the confirmation prompt counts). `ok` is inferred from
the version having moved, never from what the install screen said, so an
install that "succeeded" into the same version reads as not ok with no
error; the 6.25MB slots of a device flashed before v1.5.3 come back as
`too_large`.

A request that carries none of this (a browser, a curl, an older firmware)
is served exactly as before and counted under whatever the service already
knew: the version alone for Get Books, a salted hash of the token or the
account for the bridges. Settings > System on the device turns the headers
off; off sends nothing and records nothing.


Three rules the firmware keeps that the table above only implies: the
headers go to hosts in `ma-r-s.com` and to no other host (never Hacker News,
xkcd or GitHub); a 2xx from one of those hosts clears the pending crash and
install record, any other answer leaves them for the next request; and a
crash whose full record would not fit the 600 bytes loses its backtrace
first, then has its message cut, and never disappears for being long.

## What each service posts

The services share one reader for the headers (`bridge/events.py` in
`server/study-bridge`; `getbooks/events.py` in the Get Books repository) and
trust none of it: an id that is not 64 hex is no id, a board that is not a
short word is no board, a report over 1000 bytes or not a JSON object is
ignored with one debug line and the request served all the same, and only
numbers are copied out of the health fields.

On every request the service accepts (a 2xx or 3xx; a 401 the device will
retry posts nothing, so a crash is not counted twice), whatever the
endpoint:

- **The usage event it already posted** (`getbooks`/`search`,
  `getbooks`/`download`, `anki`/`sync`, and their
  `error` twins) gets `device` from the header (over the service's own hash
  when both exist), `board` from the header, `version` from the User-Agent,
  and `battery_pct`, `heap_min_kb`, `uptime_h` copied into `props` when the
  report carried them. The site's update-check proxy (`site/api/latest.js`)
  posts `site`/`update-check` the same way, with `props.latest` the tag it
  offered, and only for a request that carried a valid device id: a browser
  or a curl gets the JSON and is not counted.
- **A report with `crash`** posts one more event, `{"service":"firmware",
  "event":"crash","level":"error","device":..,"version":<crash.version>,
  "board":..,"props":{"message":<crash.message>,"backtrace":<crash.backtrace>,
  "app":"firmware","via":"getbooks"|"anki"}}`, so a crash in the
  field opens a card on the firmware's owner by itself, once per distinct
  reason, whichever service happened to hear it.
- **A report with `ota`** posts `{"service":"firmware","event":"update",
  "device":..,"version":..,"board":..,"props":{...the ota object...,
  "app":"firmware"}}` at level `info`, or at level `error` with
  `props.message = "update failed: <error> (<path>)"` when `ok` is false and
  an error is named, so "who cannot update" is a card with a count.

Each service says `device report via <service>: crash on <version>` or
`update <level>` in its log when it posts one. The service that heard it is
`props.via`; the card lands on the firmware.

### Live, and why it counts two things

Live (`server/fridge-bridge`) posted **nothing at all** until 2026-09-21, so on
this table it read as a service nobody used. It posts four events now, and
every one carries `props.fridge`: a salted hash of the fridge id, which is the
SETUP, not the reader.

- `pair-start` -- a reader showed a pairing code. `device` when it sent one.
- `paired` -- a browser claimed a code. No `device`: a browser sent it.
- `checkin` -- `GET /api/pull` succeeded. `device` from the reader's header.
- `image` -- a phone sent a picture. No `device`.

**`device` and `props.fridge` are two axes and are never added together.** A
fridge is a setup somebody began; a device is a reader that exists. Using the
fridge id as `device` would put every abandoned pairing into the fleet's device
count, which is the inflation this instrumentation exposes.

Live's `/api/pull` has always carried the three device headers -- it goes
through `bridge::getToFile`, which calls `identify()`, and `fridge.ma-r-s.com`
is inside the zone `isOwnHost()` allows -- so a check-in was always
attributable and this service was simply discarding them. Nothing in the
firmware changed to make Live appear per device; `host-tests/devreport` pins
that host so it cannot quietly stop being ours.

**`checkin` carries `props.n`, which check-in this was.** That field is the
point. `last_checkin` is a pure overwrite, so it answers only "ever" or
"never", and "ever" counts a reader that pulled once while somebody was
setting it up exactly like one that has woken on a fridge for a month. A
SECOND check-in is the first evidence anybody kept it, so `live_fridges`
reports `paired` and `returning` separately and the inbox page prints what
each one proves.

**A fridge record is written when a code is CLAIMED, not when it is shown.** It
used to be written at `/api/pair/start`, and the reader mints a code every time
the Live screen opens unpaired, again when one expires on screen, and again on
a 401 -- with nothing deleting the unclaimed ones. So the service held 67
fridges after nineteen hours of one person testing and "fridges" meant "visits
to a setup screen". `store.sweep_orphans()` runs at startup and removes what
that flow left behind; the current flow cannot create one.

## Reading the numbers

Signed-in users (the inbox page) lead with the owner's facts, one view
each (`20260910000200_owner_views.sql`): `devices_heard_from` (distinct
devices in the last 24 hours, 7, 30 and 90 days, one row), `devices_new`
(first heard this week and the week before), `devices_now` (every device
once, at the version it last reported, with when it arrived there; 30
days), `versions_now` (the same devices grouped ONE ROW PER VERSION, newest
first, with a `boards` map of board to count, so the table's sum IS the
device count), `field_7d` (devices that crashed, failed an install, or
installed fine) and `crashes_7d` (panics by reason, devices first). A
per-version table summed over its rows is NOT a device count: a device
that updated inside the window sits in two rows, and the page showed that
sum until 2026-09-10.

Four more since 2026-09-21 (`20260921000100_fleet_analytics.sql`), which are
the questions the page could not answer at all: `device_versions` (every
version one device has run, with when it was first and last seen on it -- the
update history), `device_services` (which services one device has used, with
counts and errors), `service_metrics` (per service: devices over 7 and 30 days,
events, errors, first and last heard) and `live_fridges` (Live's counts,
above). `version_key()` turns "1.13.15" into `{1,13,15}` so ordering is
numeric; as text "1.13.9" sorts after it and the newest release landed in the
middle of the table.

Two limits the page states rather than hides. `device_services` can only show
services with a SERVER: a game, the reader and everything else that runs on the
device posts nothing, by design, so a short list means "nothing was sent", not
"this reader does nothing". And a service that has never posted has no row in
`service_metrics` at all, so the page carries the known-service list and prints
the missing ones as silent -- absent reads as "not a service", which is exactly
how Live went unnoticed.

Under the fold, the workshop's views:
`devices_by_version` (distinct devices per board and version, over
every event with a device and a version in the last 7 days),
`daily_active_devices` (distinct devices per day, 30 days),
`battery_by_version` (board, version, the average `battery_pct` of the
events a device carried, averaged per device first so a reader that syncs
ten times a day weighs the same as one that syncs once, with the device and
report counts beside it, 7 days), `events_daily` (30 days, by service and
event), `service_users` (7 days). The inbox page shows them under "The
workshop". GitHub's download counts are not on the page: they are not
users (eleven releases cut in one day each got 6 to 16).

A device is counted when it uses a service, and since the release that
carried card 449 when it checks for an update (Settings > Update, the one request nearly every
device makes; `src/network/ReleaseSources.h`). One that only plays games,
never searches a book, syncs a deck or checks for an update is not on the
board at all, and that is the design, not a gap: "devices heard from"
means devices that did something. Downloads per release, from GitHub, is a
number for the rest, and a poor one: a release cut minutes after another
gets the same six to sixteen downloads, which is scanners and CI.
The views are in `20260903000200_events.sql` as written and
`20260904001100_devices_from_usage.sql` as they read now.

## What each owner sends (the cards)

Each service has a card on the board naming the events it should post and
where in its code. The firmware puts its headers on every request it makes
(`src/network`); Get Books and the Anki bridge post
from the pi, their own events and the firmware's; the site posts `install`
and `report`. The pipe is built; the sending is the owner's.

## The pulse: what looks from outside

A service that is down posts nothing, and on this table "no events" reads
as "no usage". So the board itself looks from outside: every 30 minutes its
scheduler (`pg_cron`) fires one HTTP request per row of `pulse_targets`
through `pg_net`, and three minutes later reads the answers
(`20260904001000_pulse_on_the_board.sql`). A host that answers with a
status its row allows is an `info` `pulse`/`probe` event; anything else, a
timeout included, is an `error` with a fixed fingerprint per host, so an
outage is one card however long it lasts, closed by the next ok probe and
reopened as a new card if it returns. The same pass checks the daily
upstream sync through GitHub's public compare API: upstream commits xteink
lacks, older than 30 hours, with no `sync/upstream-*` pull request open,
is an error on `tooling`.

It runs on the board and not on GitHub because this repository is a fork,
and GitHub does not run `schedule:` workflows in forks (five slots passed
in silence with the workflow "active"). `workflow_dispatch` was never
affected, but a pulse that has to be dispatched is not a pulse.

## The release watcher: what looks at the pipeline

The same machinery, pointed at the release chain
(`20260904001200_release_watch.sql`, `relwatch_fire` at :10 and :40,
`relwatch_collect` three minutes later). It exists because on 2026-09-04 two
releases failed, four workflow runs over five hours, and every visible signal
said healthy: the autorelease reported success (correctly, its own three steps
worked), tags appeared, the board stayed clean, and a session read a bump commit
and told Mario 1.12.15 had shipped. The only detector in the system was Mario's
e-reader saying there was no update. Automating the release automated away its
only observer.

Four unauthenticated GitHub requests per pass -- the runs of
`crossplay-release.yml` and `crossplay-autorelease.yml`, `/releases/latest`, and
the newest commits on `xteink` -- and four things it says:

There are two layers and they do not touch. The **health verdict**
(`release|owed|<version>`) asks one question -- the pipeline said it was
shipping X, is X published? -- and the **hygiene finding**
(`release|dup|<version>`) reports more than one run on a tag without being any
evidence about whether the release worked.

| What it sees                                                    | When it says so                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| A tag whose every run has ended and none succeeded, unpublished  | at once, no clock at all                          |
| A `chore: crossplay X` bump, or a tag with a run, and nothing building it | 15 minutes (a build starts within 3 seconds) |
| A tag still building, or built green, and still unpublished      | 60 minutes (48/48 healthy releases took under 20) |
| An autorelease run that ended anything but `success`/`skipped`   | at once: no release was even started              |
| More than one run on one tag (hygiene, not health)               | at once, on its own card                          |
| No answer out of GitHub at all                                   | 3 hours, six missed passes                        |

**A tag's runs are resolved as a set and no single run is ever the verdict.**
One finishing does not mean the release is done while a sibling is still going;
one failing does not mean the release failed, because another may be the one
that published; and a version at or below the newest published release has
shipped whatever its runs did. A set of one is a set -- nothing requires or
assumes two. That matters because on 2026-09-04 a tag produced two runs
(v1.12.16: 33884760714 by push and 33884760111 by dispatch, the same second,
both green), and judging either alone would have called a healthy release
broken the moment one lost the race to publish the same assets.

The duplicate is reported separately because it is invisible to every other
signal: both runs exit 0, every step reports success, and the losing upload
clobbers identical bytes built from the same commit, so "did a run fail" and
"do the assets exist" both read healthy. Multiplicity is the only observable
there is, and after the dispatch was made conditional on `RELEASE_TOKEN` a
second run means that guard regressed.

**One red autorelease run is not a failure, and this is the one.** Since
2026-09-04 the gate has three answers, not two: `scripts_local/release-needed.sh`
exits 2 when a changed path is in no row of the classification table in
`device-build-needed.sh`, and the job goes red rather than guess whether it
reaches a user. Releasing for nothing and silently withholding a real fix are
both bad answers to a question nobody has answered, so it declines to pick one.
The job log names the path; the fix is one row in that table saying whether the
path builds and whether it ships, and then re-running. The watcher will raise
its usual card, which is correct: no release was started, and somebody has to
say why the path exists.

The clocks are measured, not chosen: the 53 runs of `crossplay-release.yml`
published 48 releases, the slowest 19.9 minutes after its run was created, and
the longest any run ever occupied -- including a 16.9-minute wait for a runner
-- is 29.4 minutes. Sixty is twice the worst ever seen, and a generous margin is
cheap because it is only the backstop: a failed build is reported without
waiting for anything.

Three things it deliberately does not do. It does not collapse: each release
attempt is its own card, because the fault was that it failed and said nothing,
four times over. Two runs of ONE tag are one attempt and collapse correctly;
1.12.14 and 1.12.15 are two attempts and never merge. It does not treat an empty `conclusion` as a
success -- a run that is `completed` carrying no conclusion is *not knowing*,
and not knowing for longer than a release has ever taken is itself a fault. And
it does not confuse an old failure with a new one: every fault key it has
adjudicated is in `release_seen`, and the pass that arrives adjudicates the
history silently rather than opening a backlog. Arming requires having actually
seen GitHub, because a pass that saw nothing and armed anyway makes the pass
after it read the whole record as new.

It counts bump commits rather than tags on purpose: a tag deleted after a failed
build (which is what happened to v1.12.15) takes the evidence with it, and
`release_pending` remembers an owed version so it does not go quiet when its
bump scrolls out of the commit window. An owed version publishing posts the
`info` event that closes its own card.

`board release` says whether it is armed, when it last got an answer, and what
it is still owed. `host-tests/relwatch` drives the whole decision on a real
postgres running these same migrations, against the captured API payloads of
that morning.

## The sync run

The daily upstream-sync routine ends every run with one
`upstream-sync`/`run` event. `error` (fingerprint `upstream-sync|stopped`)
is one card until the next good run closes it. `info` with a pull request
URL in `props.result`, plus the pull request's `title` and `summary`, opens
one task card in `review` with source `sync`, so the pull request is on the
board where the orchestrator's critic finds it; a `result` of `nothing new`
opens nothing (`20260904001300_sync_pr_card.sql`).

**When your service goes live, add its row:** `board pulse add <host>
<GET|POST> <url> <alive> <app>`, where `alive` is the statuses that mean
up (`200`, `2xx,401`, ...; a 401 from a Basic-auth root is what proves the
service is up) and `app` is whose card an outage becomes. `board pulse`
lists the rows; `board pulse remove <host>` drops one. A host added before
it exists opens a card every half hour. The board records status, not
latency, so `ms` in `pulse_hosts` is empty for these probes.

## The workflow's own numbers

The board watches itself through five views: `pulse_hosts` (up now, uptime
and median latency per host, 7 days), `workflow_weekly` (cards opened and
closed, asks to Mario and his answers, error cards, hook refusals,
releases, by week), `state_dwell` (hours a card sits in each state, 30
days), `inbox_latency` (what waits on Mario now, and how long an answer
takes), `open_cards_by_app`. The hooks post a `workflow`/`refusal` event on
every refusal and write the same line to `<workspace>/.board/refusals.log`;
that count is the one that says whether the rules teach or merely obstruct.

## Retention

Raw events are kept 90 days. A nightly job (`pg_cron`, 04:17 UTC, in
`20260903000600_observability.sql`) folds the days before today into
`events_rollup` (day, service, event, level, count, distinct devices) and
deletes the raw rows past 90 days. `error_fingerprints` keeps its counts
regardless. Anything that wants a number older than 90 days reads the
rollup.
