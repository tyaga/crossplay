"""Build the X4 Pro simulator for the browser.

The desktop simulator is a PlatformIO `native` build: the whole firmware
compiled for the host with SDL2 for the panel and a FreeRTOS shim on pthreads.
Emscripten supports all three of those, so the port is mostly a translation
rather than a rewrite -- take the exact compile lines PlatformIO already
produces and run them through em++ instead of g++.

    pio run -e simulator_x4_pro -t compiledb   # once, to write compile_commands.json
    source ../.emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
    python tools_local/wasm/build.py

Why compile_commands.json rather than a hand-written source list: the source
set, the include paths and the twenty-odd -D flags are all decided by
platformio.sim.ini and its lib dependency resolution. Duplicating them here
would be a second source of truth that silently drifts the first time someone
adds a library, and the failure mode is a browser build that is subtly not the
firmware.

Three things genuinely differ from the desktop build and are handled below:

  * SDL does not come along. The desktop simulator uses it for the panel and
    the keyboard; in a browser the page already has a canvas and already gets
    pointer events, and Emscripten's SDL port wants a blocking main loop on the
    thread that owns the GL context -- which the firmware's render task is not.
    So stubs/SDL.h + src/sdl_browser.cpp answer the twenty-three SDL functions
    the simulator's two HAL files call with plain memory, and src/wasm_main.cpp
    replaces simulator_main.cpp with a main() that starts the firmware on a
    worker and returns. The page then reads the composited frame straight out
    of the heap. Nothing in src/ or lib/ changes.
  * The SD card is a directory on the host. --preload-file packages it into a
    virtual filesystem mounted at the same path.
  * Networking is libcurl, which does not exist here. See stubs/.

How this got here, so nobody spends the same three hours
--------------------------------------------------------
The first version kept SDL and reached for Emscripten flags to make main()'s
`while (!display.shouldQuit())` loop survive a browser. Every one of them cost
a day and none of them worked: -sPROXY_TO_PTHREAD puts main on a worker but
leaves SDL's canvas on the wrong thread; OFFSCREENCANVAS_SUPPORT then breaks
the runtime's own main-thread getContext; OFFSCREEN_FRAMEBUFFER trips an assert
in the proxying queue; -sASYNCIFY finally booted but every screen drawn through
FreeInkUI arrived as a fragment.

The answer was not another flag. The browser simulator on the fork's earlier
base does not use SDL at all -- the page owns the canvas, the module exports a
framebuffer pointer and an input function, and main() returns immediately with
the firmware running on a worker. That is the design here, arrived at by stubbing SDL rather than
writing a second HAL, so our own HalDisplay keeps doing the compositing and the
grayscale preview comes along.

Two real bugs also fell out of that detour and the fixes are kept:

  * `char` is unsigned on both targets this firmware runs on (ESP32-C3 RISC-V,
    Apple Silicon) and signed on wasm32, so byte arithmetic above 127 differed
    here only. -fno-signed-char makes wasm match.
  * The object cache keyed on timestamps alone, so adding a flag rebuilt
    nothing. That is why -fno-signed-char was once written off as "not the fix"
    when no object had ever seen it. compile_one() now stamps the command line.
