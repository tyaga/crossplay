# The same two folder icons again, pre-rotated, for upstream's theme.
#
# There are two icon paths on this device with opposite conventions.
# fui::bitmapFromIcon + DrawTarget::bitmap (everything in apps_local) takes
# upright bitmaps and lets the renderer map logical coordinates to the panel.
# GfxRenderer::drawIcon, which upstream's drawButtonMenu uses, rotates its input
# by -90 -- so every bitmap in src/components/icons/ is stored rotated +90 to
# come out upright. Feeding it an upright icon lands it on its side, which is
# how the joystick first shipped lying down.
