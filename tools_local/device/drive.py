"""Drive a desk device: taps, buttons, screenshots. Cable optional.

Two transports, one vocabulary:

    --port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX    the serial bridge (src/DevSerialBridge.cpp)
    --ip 192.168.68.78             Developer Mode over Wi-Fi, no cable

Wi-Fi carries the input verbs and screenshots (POST /api/dev/input, GET
/api/dev/screen) and needs a pairing token, taken from ~/.crossplay-devtoken
unless --token says otherwise. The card and diagnostic verbs (ls, cat, sd,
sdformat, writetest, heap, date, reboot) exist only on the serial bridge and
say so rather than failing obscurely.

The firmware side is src/DevSerialBridge.cpp and src/network/
CrossPointWebServer.cpp, both compiled only into the dev envs
(-DCROSSPOINT_DEV_SERIAL_BRIDGE=1); the verbs themselves live once, in
lib/DevInput/DevInputCommands.cpp, so the two transports cannot drift.
Coordinates are panel-native pixels
(800x480 landscape on both the X4 Pro and the Sticky); pass --view to give
tap/swipe coordinates in the portrait view frame instead (the frame shot.png
is saved in), and the script converts.

    uv run --with pyserial --with pillow tools_local/device/drive.py \
        --port /dev/cu.usbmodem5C850495631 ping
    ... tap 400 240
    ... btn UP
    ... swipe 10 240 300 240 250        # left-edge swipe = Back
    ... shot out.png                    # portrait view PNG + raw .pbm next to it
    ... heap
    ... watch 30                        # just relay log output for N seconds
    ... ls /.crosspoint                 # list a card directory
    ... cat /.crosspoint/shelf.cfg      # stream a card file
    ... writetest /.crosspoint/x.sav    # the exact open the games use, verbose
    ... mkdir /d, rm /f, rmdir /d       # card housekeeping
    ... sdprobe                         # raw cardBegin/volumeBegin, error codes
    ... sdformat YES                    # DESTRUCTIVE: SdFat formatter (FAT/exFAT)
    ... sd 10000000                     # remount at a given SPI clock
    ... reboot

Multiple commands can be chained with commas: "tap 400 240, sleep 2, shot s.png".
Anything not listed passes through as CMD:<VERB>, so new firmware commands need
no script change. The device logs interleave with replies on the same UART;
replies are the lines that begin with OK/ERR/SCREENSHOT_, everything else is
relayed to stderr. Opening the port can reset the device (nondeterministic):
any flow that must keep device state alive belongs in one `serve <fifo>`
session rather than one process per step.

        # extra steps, and image bytes can spell anything.
