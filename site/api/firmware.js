// GET /api/firmware?device=x4pro|sticky&tag=v1.8.0
//
// Streams one release image back to the browser, same-origin. The Install
// button cannot fetch it from GitHub itself: release assets are served from
// release-assets.githubusercontent.com, which sends no Access-Control-Allow-
// Origin at all, so a cross-origin fetch() from the page is refused before a
// single byte arrives. (COEP require-corp, set for the whole site in
// vercel.json, would refuse it a second time.) This function is the only
// moving part on an otherwise static site, and it exists for exactly that
// reason: to put those bytes on our own origin.
//
// It is a pipe, not a media server. It resolves nothing, decides nothing, and
// caches nothing.
//
// WHY THE CLIENT PASSES THE TAG. The obvious shape is /api/firmware?device=x
// with the function asking the GitHub API which release is latest. That fails
// under exactly the traffic this button was built for: unauthenticated API
// calls are rate limited per IP, and every visitor's request would come from
// the same handful of Vercel egress addresses. Sixty installs an hour, site
// wide, and the button starts answering 403. The page already asks the API for
// the latest tag from the visitor's own browser -- it did so before this
// feature existed, to print "Latest release: ..." -- so the tag is free there
// and the limit is per visitor, which nobody will ever reach.
//
// That makes the tag client-supplied, which is the SSRF question: never build
// a URL out of it without proving what it is first. Hence the two regexes
// below. They admit release tags of this repository and nothing else -- no
// slashes, no scheme, no host, no traversal -- so the worst a hostile caller
// gets is a different version of our own firmware.
