/* The Install button.
 *
 * Someone on Reddit could not flash the device and said, reasonably, that they
 * were expecting a tutorial. The answer is not a longer tutorial. Chrome and
 * Edge can talk to a USB serial port from a page, so the browser can do the
 * whole thing: pick the release, download it, write it, and say what to press
 * afterwards. The esptool instructions stay on the page underneath, for people
 * who would rather type them.
 *
 * The shape is CrossPoint's, whose web flasher has been installing firmware on
 * these devices for far longer than this one has, and whose flasher.js is
 * worth reading before changing anything here. Two deliberate differences:
 *
 *   * It writes the merged image at offset 0 -- bootloader, partition table
 *     and app in one go -- rather than dropping the app into the spare OTA
 *     slot. This fork changed its partition table (7.94MB slots, see
 *     partitions.csv) and ONLY a write at 0 lays down the new table. An OTA
 *     write leaves the device on whatever table it was last flashed with,
 *     which is the 6.25MB one, forever. Every install this button makes is a
 *     fresh, correct one; updates afterwards go over Wi-Fi. The one range it
 *     does NOT write is the NVS partition (partsToWrite below): the image
 *     carries it as blank padding, and writing that erased the device's
 *     settings, its Wi-Fi and the secret behind its id on the board, so
 *     every reinstall looked like a new device.
 *   * It is one file with no framework, because the site is one file with no
 *     framework.
 *
 * The device is not on the desk of whoever reads this next, so: the download,
 * validation and error paths are exercised by site/serve.py locally; the write
 * path is not testable without hardware and every change to it wants a real
 * flash before it ships.
