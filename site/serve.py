"""Serve this directory with the same COOP/COEP headers vercel.json sets.

The wasm build is pthreaded, so SharedArrayBuffer has to be available, which
means cross-origin isolation. A plain http.server does not send those headers
and the module silently never starts -- the canvas just stays at the shell's
300x150 default, which reads exactly like a render bug and is not one.

It also answers /api/firmware, which in production is the one Vercel function
this site has. Without it the Install button is untestable off Vercel: it fails
at the download with a 404 from the static handler, which looks exactly like a
broken endpoint and is only a missing one.

It also PROXIES every other /api/ path to the Live service
(https://fridge.ma-r-s.com, or $LIVE_API). In production /live/ calls that host
directly and the sender cookie rides along because both names sit under
ma-r-s.com; from localhost the two are cross-SITE, the Lax cookie is never
sent, and the page reports "not connected" with nothing in the console to say
why. The proxy makes the local page same-origin with the API so the journey can
be driven for real. Reached with /live/?local.

Dev only: with INBOX_FIXTURE set to a JSON file, POST /api/inbox is answered
from that file whatever the passphrase (op `list` returns its `list` object,
`numbers` its `numbers` object, `answer` says {ok: true} and changes nothing).
That is how the inbox page's layout gets looked at without a passphrase or a
board; inbox/fixture.json is the file. Without the variable the endpoint says
the inbox is not set up, which is what production says without its secrets.
Production never runs this file, so the fixture can never reach it.
