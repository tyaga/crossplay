![CrossPlay on the Xteink X4 Pro](site/assets/shots/og.png)

The **Xteink X4 Pro**, **Seeed reTerminal Sticky**, and **M5Stack PaperMono / Lite** are e-ink
devices with an 800x480 panel, capacitive touch and two physical buttons
(three on the Sticky; the design uses the two shared buttons), and
[CrossPoint](https://crosspointreader.com/) already makes them good at reading.
CrossPlay is firmware that keeps all of that and adds the other things a screen
that holds still is good at: spaced-repetition flashcards, comics, a news
reader, two games, and two devices that play together with nothing to set up.

## Try it without a device

[**crossplay.ma-r-s.com**](https://crossplay.ma-r-s.com) runs the real firmware
in the browser: the same `src/` and `lib/` the device build compiles, put
through `em++` instead of `g++`, against an SD card of its own. Click the screen
in the hero, or ask for two devices and watch them find each other.

It is the real thing rather than a video, with three things faked, all listed
in [site/README.md](site/README.md): the network answers from a snapshot,
Study's headword font is a smaller cut standing in for the large one, and sleep
is off.

## What is on it

Home shows the last two books, then **Library** across the width and, two to a
row, **Study** and **Apps**, **Settings** and **Wi-Fi**. Wi-Fi joins a network
and opens the file transfer page, the first choice of File Transfer. Study
opens straight from Home; everything else of the fork's lives in the Apps
folder.

### On Home

|           |                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Study** | Anki decks with the FSRS scheduler, offline. |

### Apps

|                   |                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Browse**        | CrossPoint's file browser.                                               |
| **File Transfer** | CrossPoint's file transfer: Wi-Fi, a hotspot, Calibre or USB.            |
| **Reading**       | Time read per day and per book, a streak, and the time left in the book. |
| **Hacker News**   | The front page in a reading serif, articles kept on the card.            |
| **xkcd**          | The archive, packed for the card and drawn one to one.                   |
| **Get Books**     | Browse any OPDS catalog and download straight to the card, no computer.  |
| **Wallpapers**    | Pick an image on the card as the sleep screen, one tap to set it.        |
| **Solitaire**     | Klondike, turned sideways because that is the shape of a tableau.        |
| **Battleship**    | Lay out a fleet, then hunt someone else's.                               |
| **Player**        | The name and face this device shows another one across the table.        |

And the reader is still CrossPoint's reader: the EPUB engine, sync and the file
browser are theirs and stay theirs.

### Two devices, nothing to type

Battleship plays over **PLAY NEARBY**. Put two devices next to each other and
they find one another. No pairing screen, no room
code, no account, no router, no internet.

### Why it is shaped like this

The decisions are written down rather than remembered. Each of these is the
short version of one of them:

- [docs/identity.md](docs/identity.md) -- why a screen that holds still is the
  point rather than a limitation. The rest is downstream of it.
- [docs/design-language.md](docs/design-language.md) -- what that means on a
  1-bit panel, and the ink budget that governs it.
- [docs/buttons.md](docs/buttons.md) -- how the two physical buttons are used,
  and why there are only two.
- [docs/apps/](docs/apps/) -- per-app rules, state machines and the decisions
  behind each one.

## Install it

> **The X4 Pro is not the X4.** CrossPlay is for the Xteink **X4 Pro** and the
> Seeed reTerminal Sticky and M5Stack PaperMono / Lite, all ESP32-S3. The plain **X4** and the **X3** are
> ESP32-C3, and writing an S3 image to one of those used to brick it. Install
> [CrossPoint](https://crosspointreader.com/) on those instead: it is excellent,
> and it is what this is built on.
>
> **You do not have to work out which you have.** The browser installer below
> reads the chip off the device before it writes anything, and stops with
> "Nothing was written" if it is a C3. Between the supported S3 devices every image
> carries its board name and both updaters refuse an image built for the other
> board.

Open [**crossplay.ma-r-s.com/#get**](https://crossplay.ma-r-s.com/#get) in
Chrome or Edge on a computer, plug the device in, wake it, and press **Install**.
The page downloads the current release and writes it over USB itself; there is
nothing to install first and no command to type. Safari and Firefox have no Web
Serial, and no phone or tablet does either, so the button says so rather than
failing when pressed.

You do not need to have installed CrossPoint first. Flashing replaces the
firmware, not the SD card: your library, your reading positions and your fonts
are left alone, and installing stock CrossPoint over the top puts the device
back where it was.

[**docs/install.md**](docs/install.md) covers the rest: installing by hand with
esptool, updating a device you already flashed, a **USB-locked X4 Pro** (the
Xteink Unlocker to CrossPoint, then our `firmware.bin` from the SD card), and
Developer Mode, which reflashes over Wi-Fi with no cable. If a flash goes wrong,
[docs/fix-bricked-xteink.md](docs/fix-bricked-xteink.md) is the way back.

Once it is running, [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) is the guide to the device
itself: the controls, the reader, the web server and what to do when something
goes wrong. It is upstream's guide with this fork's hardware folded in, so it
covers several boards at once: where it names Left or Right, that is the older
X4, which had a front button row the X4 Pro dropped. Back here is a swipe and
Confirm exists only on the Sticky, which
[docs/buttons.md](docs/buttons.md) explains.

Every release is flashed to a real X4 Pro and a real Sticky before it ships.
That is still a small field record, so if you install it, please
[say what happened](https://github.com/ma-r-s/crossplay/issues), either way.

## What it does over the network

Most of the shelf never touches the network. Of the parts that do:

- **Reading positions sync to CrossPoint's own server by default.** That is
  upstream's infrastructure rather than this fork's, inherited so that flashing
  CrossPlay over CrossPoint does not orphan an existing sync. The address is a
  setting and can be pointed at any KOSync server.
- **xkcd, Hacker News and Get Books** fetch what you ask them for, when you
  ask. xkcd's comics are downloaded once onto the card.
- **Opening a Hacker News article sends its URL to a third party.** The story
  list comes from the public [Algolia API](https://hn.algolia.com/api), and
  opening an article proxies it through [r.jina.ai](https://r.jina.ai) to get
  readable text back, so that service learns what you read. It is a choice, not
  an accident, which is why it is written here.
- **Developer Mode is off** until you turn it on. While it is on the device
  will not deep-sleep, and the panel says so.

## Build it

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive   # freeink-sdk, and nothing builds without it
pio run -e x4pro                          # the firmware
pio run -e simulator_x4_pro               # a desktop simulator, SDL2 + a FreeRTOS shim
./scripts_local/check.sh                  # host tests and both builds
```

Always name an environment. A bare `pio run` builds `[env:default]`, which is
upstream's ESP32-C3 target: the chip the install warning above says not to
write an S3 image to. [docs/contributing/](docs/contributing/) is the long
version of all of this -- prerequisites, the clone, the hooks, what CI checks
and how a branch lands.

The apps live in `src/apps_local/`, which is what keeps the merge with upstream
close to conflict-free. Read [LOCAL_SCOPE.md](LOCAL_SCOPE.md) for what the fork
owns and what it turns down, [docs/shelf.md](docs/shelf.md) for the shelf
contract, and [docs/building-apps.md](docs/building-apps.md) for how an app is
put together. [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) indexes the rest, including
[docs/workflow/](docs/workflow/), which is how the work itself is run.
`site/` is the static website and the browser build;
[site/README.md](site/README.md) says how to serve it.

re-implementing it. It stands on CrossPoint and the

xkcd comics are by Randall Munroe, [CC BY-NC 2.5](https://xkcd.com/license.html),
