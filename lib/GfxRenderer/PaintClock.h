// How many times the panel has finished showing something.
//
// This exists because of a gap nothing else in the fork can see. Building a
// screen and SHOWING it are two different moments separated by a very long
// time: GfxRenderer::displayBuffer() blocks for 0.3-2s while the waveform
// runs (HalDisplay::HALF_REFRESH is 1720ms). Every app publishes its new hit
// table BEFORE that call, so for up to a full refresh the firmware routes
// taps against a screen the user cannot see yet, and a finger still resting
// where the previous screen's button was lands on whatever the new screen put
// underneath it.
//
// A counter rather than a timestamp on purpose. "Has the panel shown anything
// since this table was built" is the actual question, and a count answers it
// exactly, with no threshold to tune and nothing to get wrong when a refresh
// runs long. A settle delay in milliseconds would be the same idea with a
// guess in place of the fact.
//
// Freestanding by design -- no Arduino, no renderer, nothing. The toybox
// layer includes it by relative path so the screen builders stay host-testable
// with only the SDK on the include path (host-tests/ui/run.sh).
//
// One invariant this rests on, unstated until now and worth failing loudly on.
// The count is of ANY paint, not of a paint of any particular screen, so it
// says "the panel has moved on" rather than "your table is what is showing".
// That is only equivalent because every screen in this fork builds its table
// and paints it in the same function, as adjacent statements. A path that
// builds a table and returns WITHOUT painting would mark it revealed at the
// next unrelated paint -- a pushed panel, a popup drawn over a game. If you
// are adding one, gate it yourself or do not route against it.
//
// Not atomic. The render task writes it and the loop task reads it, and on
// this target a 32-bit aligned load or store is single-instruction anyway. A
// torn read cannot happen; a stale read can, and the consequence of a stale
// read is one extra dropped tap on a screen the user could not see, which is
// the behaviour this file exists to produce.

// How long the PANEL itself was busy, as opposed to how long our code took.
//
// Added while chasing GitHub issue #7 ("page turning is slow"), where the one
// number nobody could get was the split. A page turn is a single 4.2s wall
// event on the user's device; the panel's own driver prints its refresh time
// (772ms on the SSD1677 X4 Pro), so the remaining ~3.4s is ours -- but the
// firmware never subtracted the two, and the only breakdown it had lived in
// LOG_DBG lines that release builds (LOG_LEVEL=1) compile out entirely. So the
// report arrived as "it feels slow" and no build a user can install could say
// any more than that.
//
// It bills WALL time inside HalDisplay calls, not waveform time. That is the
// honest unit: an async refresh that overlaps our rendering is billed only for
// the wait that actually blocks us, which is what the user waits for too.
//
// depth_ makes a nested call count once rather than twice. Nothing nests
// today, but a paint helper that grows a second display call inside an
// existing span would otherwise double-bill it and report panel time larger
// than the repaint that contains it -- a wrong number that still looks
// plausible, which is the failure mode worth designing out rather than
// commenting on.
//
// Timestamps in, no clock of its own: this header stays freestanding (see
// above) and the accumulator stays testable with a fake clock rather than by
// sleeping. host-tests/panelclock is that test.
