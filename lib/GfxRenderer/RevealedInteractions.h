// Routing that waits for the panel, for every screen in the fork rather than
// only the toybox ones.
//
// The gap this closes. Building a screen and SHOWING it are separated by a
// whole panel refresh -- 0.3-2s; HalDisplay::HALF_REFRESH alone is 1720ms.
// Every screen in this fork builds its table, publishes it, and only then
// calls displayBuffer(), so for the length of a refresh the loop task routes
// taps against a screen nobody can see yet. A finger still resting where the
// PREVIOUS screen's button was gets read against the NEW screen's table.
//
// The sharp version of the failure is not "the screen changed", it is a rect
// whose MEANING changed underneath a stationary finger. BattleshipScreens.cpp
// registers one capsule as `gameOver ? ActionPlayAgain : (canFire ? ActionFire
// : NO_ACTION)`: FIRE is tapped dozens of times a game and becomes PLAY AGAIN
// the instant the last shot lands, while the panel still reads FIRE, and the
// player is trained onto that exact pixel.
//
// The rule, and why it is this rule. A tap routes unless what it would act on
// has changed since the last version the panel showed, and no paint has landed
// since that change. Three consequences, all deliberate:
//
//   * an UNCHANGED table always routes. That is what keeps touch-down feedback
//     working, and it is the difference between this and a device that reads
//     as frozen. Apps highlight a row on touch-DOWN, repaint, and act on the
//     RELEASE of that same contact; those repaints rebuild an identical table,
//     so nothing is gated. Suppressing the contact outright -- the obvious fix
//     -- would have been far worse than eating a release, because
//     InputManager::suppressTouchContact() also gates isTouchTapCandidate,
//     isTouchHeldAt and wasSwipe, so it would cancel every hold gesture
//     WHILE the finger is down.
//   * the gate is held by a CHANGE, not by a timer, and it opens on the very
//     next completed paint. There is no threshold to tune and no path where a
//     slow refresh leaves input dead longer than the refresh itself.
//   * before the first paint of all -- host tests, and the moment before the
//     boot splash -- nothing is gated, because there is no shown screen to
//     disagree with.
//
// This header holds the two shapes the fork actually has. Both live here, next
// to PaintClock.h, because the seam sits below every app: the toybox screens,
// the shared components (OptionPopup, KeyboardEntryActivity) and the games'
// geometry hit-tests all need it and none of them can reach the others.
//
//   * RevealedInteractions<N> -- a screen routed through an SDK
//     InteractionBuffer. The "what it would act on" is the table, and the
//     class computes the digest itself.
//   * SurfaceGate -- a play surface hit-tested against GEOMETRY. An 80-cell
//     board does not fit an interaction table, so those taps never reach
//     route() and no digest can see them. The meaning is instead the handful
//     of mode bits the hit-test reads, and only the app knows them.

// MEANS is not in the table either: a mode toggle registered with an
// identical rect, action, value and inputMask flips only StateSelected, which
// the digest deliberately ignores as paint, yet the mode bit it sets decides
// what a grid tap does.
//
// So the app supplies the meaning, as one number. Both calls must derive it
// from the SAME expression -- an app that hashes a mode bit in render() and a
// stale copy of it in loop() has a gate that is silently always open, which
// looks exactly like a gate that works. Activity::surfaceMeaning() exists so
// there is one definition to call twice rather than two to keep in step.
//
// Note what is deliberately NOT in a meaning: anything that only changes how
// the board draws. A cell outline that follows a held finger, a flashing
// cursor, a redrawn score. Folding those in would gate the release of the very
// contact that caused the repaint, which is the failure this whole mechanism
// is shaped to avoid.
//
// Two tasks touch it: the render task stamps (via ActivityManager, around the
// render dispatch) and the loop task asks. The fields are plain uint32_t, the

// 32-bit aligned load or store is single-instruction on both targets, so a
// torn read cannot happen. A stale read can, and it resolves as "a paint has
