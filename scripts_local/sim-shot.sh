# A missing glyph is ALWAYS a layout bug, and it is the one bug this panel
# cannot show you. The SDK truncates overflowing text with U+2026, and the
# Toybox cuts DO NOT ALL CARRY IT: toybox_10 has the ellipsis, 14/20/30/44/64 do
# not. A glyph the face lacks draws as nothing at all, so at every cut above 10
# an overflowing line does not arrive as a clipped word or a box character --
# the sentence just stops, at a plausible-looking place, and the screenshot
# looks fine: a settings row reads "RE", or a first run's only sentence runs
# off the side.
#
# The corollary is this gate's coverage: an overflow at the 10px cut draws a
# real "..." and logs nothing, so the gate cannot see it -- and does not need
# to, because a human can. Above 10 the gate is the only thing that can.
#
# The renderer logs it every single time, on every screen, for computed boxes as
# well as fixed ones, which makes this a better gate than any table of strings
# could be. It was already in the trace above and exited 0, which is the failure
# mode docs warn about in its own right: a printed error that nothing acts on
# reads exactly like a note.

  # cannot draw at all, which is usually unsanitised text from outside: a
