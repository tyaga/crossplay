#!/bin/bash
# Run TWO X4 Pro simulators at once, so local multiplayer can be tested the only
# way that means anything: two devices in the same room finding each other.
#
#   ./scripts/sim-link.sh                                        # two windows to play with
#   ./scripts/sim-link.sh '<input-script>' '<shots>' [out-dir]   # scripted, headless
#
# With no arguments it opens two windows side by side and waits. Play one
# against the other with the mouse; close either window (or Ctrl-C) to stop
# both. That is the point of the whole exercise, so it is the default.
#
# Both devices run the same input script by default, which is the usual case:
# they are doing the same thing to meet each other. Set SIM_LINK_INPUT_B and
# SIM_LINK_SHOTS_B for an asymmetric test, which is how you check what one
# device shows when the other one walks away.
#
# Script syntax is sim-shot.sh's. Screenshot paths get -a and -b inserted before
# the extension, so '9000:./qa-artifacts/link.bmp' writes link-a.bmp and
# link-b.bmp.
#
# Each device gets its own SD card (fs_link_a, fs_link_b) so their saves and
# settings cannot interfere -- and so neither disturbs Mario's dev.sh game in
# fs_mario or the single-device runs in fs_agent. SIM_LINK_FRESH=1 wipes both
# first, which you want whenever a stale save would change where the taps land.
#
# Example -- both devices boot into Battleship (the environment reaches both):
#   CROSSPLAY_AUTOSTART=battleship ./scripts_local/sim-link.sh \
#     '20000:QUIT' \
#     '12000:./qa-artifacts/battleship.bmp'
