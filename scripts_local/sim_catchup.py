"""Bring the CrossPoint simulator up to this branch.

The simulator library (crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-simulator) tracks
CrossPoint's `develop`, which lags this fork's device HAL. main.cpp and lib/hal
use methods and symbols the fetched simulator does not have yet, and header
stubs in sim-stubs/ cannot supply them: a library's own include path wins over
the project's -I, so the simulator's own HalStorage.h / Arduino.h / BoardConfig.h
always shadow ours. Patching the fetched copy is the only thing that works, so
this runs as a `pre:` hook on every simulator build.

Deliberately NOT sent upstream as a PR. Mario wants to see how CrossPoint solves
the same problem and compare, and a merged PR would make their answer ours.

WRITING A PATCH

Every edit is idempotent (keyed on `marker`, a symbol the insertion leaves
behind for good -- never on the replacement text; see patch()). Two rules keep
a patch robust across a re-fetch:

  * Anchor on text the PRISTINE simulator package already contains, never on a
    line another patch inserts later in the same file. A warm tree hides the
    difference -- the other patch already ran -- and a fresh tree does not: the
    anchor is missing, the patch silently no-ops, and the build breaks 30s later
    as an undefined symbol in a file the patch never touched.
  * Keep the anchor inside the replacement, so the order patches run in cannot
    matter.

WHEN A PATCH STOPS APPLYING

A patch whose anchor is gone is NEVER harmless: either the simulator caught up
and the patch is dead (delete it), or its anchor drifted and the build is about
to break somewhere unrelated. So a non-applying patch is collected and FAILS the
build at the end (require_all_applied), loudly and by name -- not a one-line
warning mid-scroll, which is how three dead patches taught everyone to ignore
the line a real one needed (card #140). "Already applied" (the marker is present)
is silent and fine; only a missing anchor or a missing file is the failure.

    # lib/hal/HalStorage.h declares one surface; the simulator ships a SECOND
    # implementation of the same class, and platformio.sim.ini's `lib_ignore = hal`
    # means a library's own headers shadow ours. Nothing in lib/hal says so. Add a
    # method there and the device gets it, the simulator does not, and the build
    # stays green until some app calls it -- at which point the error names a file
    # that app never touched. That is how freeBytes shipped (2026-08-31): the
    # first caller found it.
    #
    # The knowledge lived in two places neither reachable from the file you edit.
    # Now the two surfaces are compared here, after the patches above have run,
    # which is the one moment both exist in their final form. Divergence is zero
    # today, so this cannot go red on anything but a real one.
