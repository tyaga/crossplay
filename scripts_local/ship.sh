# Land a reviewed branch and publish its release, from this Mac, in one command.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Measured 2026-09-08..09-21 over 400 runs and 54 merged pull
# requests: one change was compiled FOUR times from cold on GitHub (the pull
# request, the merge, the tag, and the autorelease's own version-bump commit),
# about 4,955 runner-minutes, 92 per merged pull request, and 40 minutes of
# wall clock between a merge and the assets existing. Mario, 2026-09-21: "it
# takes over an hour... I am the only developer and everything runs on my
# laptop... I want the whole thing to take under a minute."
#
# None of those four builds was new work. `check.sh --committed` already clones
# the committed tree detached into TMPDIR, inits submodules, and builds
# `gh_release_x4pro`, `gh_release_sticky` and `gh_release_papermono` against the shared object cache --
# the exact two envs crossplay-release.yml recompiled forty minutes later. The
# binary a user installs already existed on this disk and was thrown away.
#
# THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE DESIGN, and it is not the order the pipeline used.
#
# `platformio.ini` gives both release envs -DCROSSPOINT_VERSION="${crossplay
# .version}", so the version is COMPILED IN, and OtaUpdater.cpp:119 compares a
# release's tag (minus the v) against that compiled string. Publish a binary
# built before the bump under the tag after it and every device that installs
# it still reads its own version as the old one, so the update it just applied
# stays on offer forever. That is why the old pipeline rebuilt after the bump,
# and it is the one thing "just ship the gate's output" cannot do naively.
#
# So: bump FIRST, gate SECOND, and the images the gate leaves behind are the
# images that ship. Nothing is rebuilt and nothing is stale.
#
# THE GATE ALWAYS RUNS, and an earlier draft of this skipped it when the bump
# turned out to be a no-op. That was wrong twice over. check.sh --committed
# builds in a throwaway worktree that its own trap deletes, so a skipped gate
# leaves NOTHING to package; and on a tree where somebody had run `check.sh
# --flash gh_release_x4pro`, it left a PRE-BUMP image sitting in
# $REPO/.pio/build that would have passed every check here and published
# under the new tag. One gate, every time, and the images come from that
# gate's own handover directory named after the commit. That is still three
# builds fewer than the pipeline this replaced.
#
#   ./scripts_local/ship.sh --dry-run        # say what would happen, touch nothing
#   ./scripts_local/ship.sh                  # land this branch and publish
#
# WHAT THIS REFUSES TO DO. It does not land a branch that is behind xteink.
# The squash it performs produces a commit whose tree equals the branch tip's
# only while the branch is current; behind trunk, the squash resolves a merge
# and lands a tree nobody built. Rebase and re-gate; the message says so, and
# the trees are compared again after the merge rather than assumed.

# HERE, because the pull request is merged only now and release_notes.py
# needs that: it maps commits to pull requests by mergeCommit.oid, and the
# oid did not exist until the squash above. Written before it, every line
# fell back to humanize(commit subject) and the release:minor label was never
# seen, so every release was silently a patch bump.
#
# Safe to change the tree after the build because NOTHING HERE IS COMPILED.
# release_notes.py touches platformio.ini, docs/release-body.md and
# docs/release-notes.md.
#
# --version IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE. Left to itself release_notes.py computes
# bump(whatever platformio.ini says), and by this point platformio.ini says
# $NEXT because the version step wrote it -- so it produced $NEXT + 1,
# rewrote both notes files for a release that would never exist, pushed
# that to xteink, and only then died on the tag guard. After the squash,
# which is not undoable by re-running. The tag lands on this
# commit, so the tagged tree's CODE is byte-identical to what was built and
# the tag carries the notes it publishes -- which is what host-tests/release
# wants when it compares a release against the previous tag.
