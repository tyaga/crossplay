# The trial worktree's path embeds the pid ("xteink-committed-$TAG-$$"), so the
# inner run's own TAG -- a hash of that path -- is UNIQUE PER RUN. Keyed on it,
# the inner wrote its ~38MB of logs into a directory no later run would ever

# that directory by construction. Only the 24h sweep ever collected it: measured
# 2026-09-05, 234 dirs / 4.4GB, essentially all of it one day's --committed runs.
#
# Carrying the OUTER path across the boundary makes the trial run write into the
# directory keyed on the user's REAL tree, so there is one per tree, reused and
# overwritten, and the green-verdict rm at the foot of this file collects it like
# any other run's. It also puts a failed --committed run's logs at a STABLE path
# for that tree instead of a per-pid one nobody could predict.

# thing that actually broke three runs on 2026-09-05 was not this directory at
# all: it was agents inventing their own name for the output, all of them
# reaching for `<scratchpad>/gate.log`, in a scratchpad that is shared between
# every agent under one session id. One run truncated and rewrote another's log
# mid-build, and the reader saw "all green." while its own gate was still
# compiling. A truncated-then-rewritten log reads as a legitimate result.
#
# So the gate names the file, and names it with mktemp: unrepeatable by

# `c++` on macOS is Apple clang. CI builds the same suites with GCC and
# -Werror, and GCC rejects things clang accepts -- an enum beside a plain
# integer in a conditional, most often -- and on 2026-08-12 it also fell over
# outright, aborting in gimplify on a `d = Draft{}` inside a deep nesting. So a
# fully green check.sh sat next to a red CI for four pushes.
#
# The expensive part was not the errors, it was the loop: CI reports only the
# FIRST one and takes about fifteen minutes to do it, so two errors meant two
# rounds. One local GCC pass finds them all.
#
# Every suite that compiles app sources with -Werror, not just the ui one. That
# used to say "the ui suite alone", and the day a second such suite existed
# (host-tests/tilefit) it went red on CI while this step reported ok -- because
# the step never ran it. A list of one is a list that stops being right without
# anyone editing it.
#
# Note what this still cannot see: ui, dungeon and revealsweep each pass
# -Wno-format-truncation, so the whole truncation class is invisible in them
# under GCC as well as clang. Removing that flag today surfaces 19 real
# too-small buffers across eleven apps; card #256 carries them. tilefit does not
# suppress it, which is why CI caught a 24-byte buffer that needed 39.

  # ONE `pio run` for every firmware env, and it is not an optimisation.
  #
  # PlatformIO decides whether to wipe .pio/build ONCE PER INVOCATION, before it
  # looks at a single env: run/cli.py calls clean_build_dir() on the build ROOT,
  # which rmtree's all of it when compute_project_checksum() differs from the
  # checksum stored inside it. That checksum is over the FILE LIST under src/,
  # include/ and lib/ -- and this project's pre-scripts (build_html.py,
  # gen_i18n.py) write gitignored sources into exactly those directories as the
  # build runs. So on a fresh checkout the checksum changes DURING invocation
  # #1, and invocation #2 opens by deleting invocation #1's output. Measured in
  # this tree: 3b39195a before gen_i18n.py ran, d6a9a8f2 after.
  #
  # That is what broke v1.12.14 and v1.12.15: the release job built x4pro, built
  # sticky, and then could not find .pio/build/gh_release_x4pro/bootloader.bin,
  # because the DIRECTORY was gone. PRs #40 and #41 route around it by capturing
  # each device's artefacts before the next build starts, which is correct and
  # is an ordering rule nothing asserts at the point it matters. One invocation
  # removes the hazard instead of avoiding it: clean_build_dir runs once, sees
  # one checksum, and no env can delete another's output.
  #
  # A unit is one invocation. Simulator envs go one at a time -- native, no
  # lock, and the build everybody actually waits on -- and every firmware env
  # goes in a single unit, comma-joined, expanded back into repeated -e below.
  #
  # Every env in that firmware unit reaches into the shared ~/.platformio, so
  # the lock must SPAN it. The unit is derived from the list rather than named,
  # because naming is how this broke before: gh_release_x4pro and
  # gh_release_sticky were appended in 2f860bee and the hardcoded release on
  # "sticky" was not moved with them, so for a week both release builds ran with
  # no lock at all. That makes a release gate and any other tree's device build
  # collide by design, and it surfaces as a missing framework header naming no

# had a fixed card layout. A user-test agent caught it; nothing here did.

# is the honest answer to "did it pass", and the one all three readings above
# got wrong in the direction of "yes".
