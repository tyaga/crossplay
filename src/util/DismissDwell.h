// How long a verdict screen has actually been LOOKED AT, as opposed to how
// long it has existed.
//
// A screen that dismisses itself on a timer measures the wrong thing twice.
// It starts counting when the code decides to show something, which on this
// panel is 0.3-2s before anything appears (HalDisplay::HALF_REFRESH is
// 1720ms), and it keeps counting while the reader's own thumb is sitting on
// top of the message. A result screen drawn correctly can go unseen by every
// cold tester for exactly those two reasons.
//
// So the dwell runs only while both are true: the panel has SHOWN the screen,
// and nobody is touching the glass. A finger arriving mid-dwell restarts it
// rather than shortening it -- a reader whose hand is on the device has not
// finished with the screen, and the worst outcome of guessing wrong is that
// the message stays up until they lift off.
//
// Freestanding on purpose: no Arduino, no renderer, no input manager. `nowMs`
// and the two facts come from the caller, which is what makes the rule
// testable without a device (host-tests/opdssaved). The activity that owns it
// cannot be built on the host at all, and a rule that can only be exercised by
// hand is a rule nobody watches fail.

// on two absolute stamps, so millis() rolling over at 49.7 days shortens
