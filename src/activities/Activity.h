  // ---- The play-surface reveal gate. See lib/GfxRenderer/RevealedInteractions.h.
  //
  // An activity that hit-tests a play surface against GEOMETRY (a 100-cell
  // board does not fit a 24-slot interaction table) never reaches route(), so
  // toybox::Interactions cannot see those taps. What such a tap MEANS is not
  // in the table either: a mode toggle registered with an identical rect,
  // action, value and inputMask flips only StateSelected, which the digest
  // ignores as paint -- while the mode bit it sets decides what a grid tap
  // does.
  //
  // An activity opts in by overriding surfaceMeaning() and guarding its
  // hit-test with surfaceRevealed(). Both call surfaceMeaning(), so there is
  // ONE definition of what a tap means rather than two expressions to keep in
  // step -- a gate whose two halves drift apart is silently always open, which
  // looks exactly like a gate that works.
  //
  // The build-side stamp is NOT the app's job: ActivityManager takes it around
  // the single render dispatch, so a new screen cannot forget it, and it is
  // taken on EVERY render including the ones that draw no play surface -- skip
  // those and builtAtPaint_ goes stale and the gate is silently always open.
  // The default meaning is 0 for every activity that does not override, and
  // 0 == 0 always routes, so this is a no-op for everything not opted in.
  //
  // THE TRAP, and it fails silently in the open direction: surfaceMeaning() is
  // evaluated just BEFORE render() runs, so it must be derived only from state
  // that loop() has already settled -- a mode flag, a screen enum, a seat, a
  // turn. Never from something render() itself writes. An app that caches the
  // pixel-to-cell layout in a member during render (solitaire does): hashing
  // that member reads the PREVIOUS frame's layout at
  // stamp time and the new one at tap time, so the gate compares against a
  // frame that was never on the panel. Hash what DETERMINES the layout instead
  // -- the view, the puzzle index -- which loop() owns and render() only reads.

  // What a tap on this activity's play surface means right now. Fold several
  // values together with paintclock::mixMeaning starting from kMeaningSeed.
  //
  // Exactly three things belong in one, and the temptation to add a fourth is
  // what makes this gate worse than the bug:
  //
  //   1. Surface identity and whether it is live at all -- the screen or view
  //      enum, plus the dead/live bit (over, yourTurn, generating,
  //      computerThinking). This is where the changes nobody's finger caused
  //      show up: an opponent's move arriving over the link, a generator
  //      finishing, an auto-transition to a result screen.
  //   2. The pixel-to-cell map -- anything the coordinate arithmetic ITSELF
  //      reads. A board that turns 180 degrees for the seat in Pass-and-Play;
  //      battleship's two grids, which have different cell sizes.
  //   3. Mode bits that reinterpret EVERY cell at once, such as a toggle that
  //      makes every grid tap mark instead of act.
  //
  // Leave OUT the surface's contents and the user's transient selection, and
  // leave them out for the same reason rather than by a causality argument:
  // neither moves which cell a pixel is, and the handler consulting them is
  // the category the table digest already ignores. The separating test is
  // uniform versus local. A mode bit reinterprets every cell under a finger
  // resting anywhere; a selected square reinterprets exactly the one cell the
  // player just deliberately touched. Fold a selection in and you gate the
  // second half of select-then-move, which is every move in solitaire, and
  // aim-then-fire, which is how battleship shoots. Fold the contents in and
  // you gate every consecutive entry and mark.
