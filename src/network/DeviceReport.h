// Device reporting: the device never makes a request of its own to report.
//
// When the firmware talks to one of CrossPlay's own services for some other
// reason (a Get Books catalog page, an Anki sync), that
// request carries three headers: a hashed device id, the board, and a small
// JSON report (battery, lowest free heap, uptime, and, only while pending, the
// panic the device just recovered from and the install it attempted). The
// service posts the events; the device never brings the radio up for this,
// never opens a connection of its own, and adds nothing to any other host.
//
// Settings > System > "Include anonymous device info when using CrossPlay
// services" turns all of it off, and off records nothing. The rules are pure
// functions in DeviceReportCore.h (host-tests/devreport); this file is the
// card, the clock and the settings. Contract: docs/workflow/events.md.

namespace devreport {

// After the card is mounted, HalSystem::checkPanic() has run and settings are
// loaded. Reads the state file and, on a boot after a panic, records it.
// `panicReasonRecorded` is HalSystem::panicReasonRecorded() as read BEFORE
// checkPanic() cleared the marker: false means the reason in RTC memory is a
// previous crash's, and the record names only the reset and the last logger.
void begin(bool rebootedFromPanic, bool panicReasonRecorded);

// The headers a request to `url` carries: kHeaderCount when the host is one
// of ours and the toggle is on, 0 otherwise. The values point into this
// module's buffers and are valid until the next call; requests run one at a
// time. Nothing in the simulator, which is not a device.
