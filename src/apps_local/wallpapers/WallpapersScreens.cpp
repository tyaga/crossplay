// and never was. Drawn as one, "This reader already has 4 phones. Remove one
// first." reached the panel as "This reader already has 4 phones...." with the
// only actionable half of it gone.
//
// So: the prose cut when it fits on a line, exactly as before, and otherwise
// the condensed cut and up to three of them. Through fitLines either way, so a
// sentence longer than even that is marked with the "..." this face can really
// draw rather than a U+2026 that would be a hole.
//
// BOTH HALVES OF THE SCREEN GO THROUGH THIS NOW. The unpaired half drew its
// status with drawFitted, which is one row and no step down, so a transport's
// sentence reached the panel as "Could not reach the sync..." -- with the half
// that says what to do about it gone. That is the same defect this function
// was written for, on the other state of the same screen (fix-the-twin-too).
// THE RUNG IT STEPS DOWN TO IS THE CALLER'S, and that is not a preference.
// The two halves of this screen bind DIFFERENT FACES TO THE SAME SLOTS: paired,
// FONT_SLOT_SMALL is toybox_14 and a genuine condensed rung; unpaired,
// pairingCodeFaces puts the EIGHTY-TWO PIXEL code face in that same slot. A
// report that stepped "down" to FONT_SLOT_SMALL on the unpaired half therefore
// drew a transport's sentence three words high, off the bottom of the panel and
// through the footer -- which is what the simulator showed the first time this
