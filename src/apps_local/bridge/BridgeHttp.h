// Talking to one of Mario's bridge services: verified TLS on the device,
// curl in the simulator, and a sentence for every failure.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why this file exists, and what is still duplicated.
//
// The Study app got here first and grew this transport inside StudySync.cpp:
// the root bundle loader, the SD override, the heap floor TLS needs, the
// dev-build diagnosis probe, and the two shapes of request. All of it is
// service-agnostic, and a second bridge would have meant a second copy of a
// certificate bundle and a second copy of a heap threshold -- the kind of
// twin that gets fixed on one path and not the other (see the fix-the-twin-too
// memory; every instance of that pattern in this repo started here).
//
// So Live uses this and Study does not, YET. Study's copy is deliberately
// untouched because app/studyradio is a long-lived branch sitting on top of
// StudySync.cpp, and refactoring under it would turn a merge into an
// archaeology session. Moving Study onto this file is listed in
// docs/open-items.md.
//
// The one thing that is NOT duplicated is the certificate bundle: this
// includes Study's, because both services sit behind the same operator's
// Cloudflare tunnel and a CA rotation must be one edit rather than two.

// Live is the reason this exists. Its whole design rests on two headers the
// buffered transport below could neither send nor read: If-None-Match on the
// way out, so a wake that finds nothing costs a few hundred bytes instead of
// 48KB, and X-Next-Wake on the way back, so a sleeping device learns when to
// come up again without a clock of its own to reason against.
//
// Fixed arrays rather than vectors, because this is built on the path INTO deep
// sleep, where the heap is already tight enough that this file checks a floor
// before it opens a socket. Four is more than any caller here needs, and a
// fifth is dropped rather than grown -- silently on purpose, because the
// alternative is an allocation on the one path that must not fail.

//
// streamToFile treats anything but a 200 as a failure, which is right for a
// download somebody asked for and wrong for Live: 304 and 204 ARE the answer,
// and both have to reach the caller with their headers intact. So this returns
// the status instead of a bool.
//
// `destPart` is opened LAZILY, on the first byte of body. That is not a
// micro-optimisation: 304 and 204 carry no body, so on those statuses the card
// is never opened, never truncated and never written -- which is the entire
// point of the conditional request. Opening it up front would put an SD write
// on exactly the wake that exists to avoid one.
//
// `maxBytes` is a CEILING, not an expected size, and it is the difference
// between this and streamToFile. Live's images have more than one valid length
// -- the sleep screen is not one bit -- so the body is bounded here, to stop a
// runaway response filling the card, and judged by its own content afterwards.
// `received` reports what arrived so the caller can do that judging.
