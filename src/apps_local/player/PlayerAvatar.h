// The face a name describes.
//
// This is the whole of the avatar system's public surface, and it is small on
// purpose: every caller passes the name string it already has and gets a
// drawing. There is no avatar to store, no avatar to send, and no avatar that
// can drift out of step with the name, because there is no avatar -- there is a
// name and a function.
//
// That is what makes it free over the link. `LinkModel::theirName` is a string
// that already crossed the radio; drawing their face is the same call as
// drawing yours. Nothing was added to LinkProtocol for this.
//
// Freestanding: SDK only, no renderer, no storage. host-tests/ui compiles it
// with nothing else on the include path, which is what lets the screens that
// draw avatars stay testable.

// Two sizes, and there is no third. Portrait is the settings screen, where the
// face is the subject of the page. Row is everywhere the face sits beside a
// name in a list -- the shelf footer, both link seats. A new place picks
// whichever of these it is closer to rather than generating another size:
// each one costs 25 bitmaps of flash.

// drawn black everywhere else. A 1-bpp mask painted in the
// colour behind it is invisible and nothing warns you -- the multiplayer mark
// went black-on-black and then white-on-white before anyone looked.
