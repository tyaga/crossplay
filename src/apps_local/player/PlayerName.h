// Who this device is: a name in three parts, and the face those parts describe.
//
// Device-wide on purpose, and this is the part worth getting right: a DS asked
// you for a nickname once, in System Settings, and then every game it ever ran
// used it. No game asked, no game stored its own, and no game had a naming
// screen. Any app in this fork gets the same deal -- call name() and you are
// done.
//
// There is no keyboard, and that is a feature rather than a gap. Typing on a
// 1-bit panel with a 500ms refresh is a chore, and a name is not information
// the player is trying to communicate; it is a label they need to recognise.
// So it is rolled from word lists, the way a console hands you one. That also
// means it can never be empty, never be rude, and never need validating.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The three words ARE the face.
//
// Slot 0 is the hair, slot 1 the eyes, slot 2 the mouth. SPIKY GRIM BEARD is a
// name and it is also a drawing instruction, which is what makes rolling one
// worth doing: you tap the middle word and you watch the eyes change. A single
// reroll button gave you a name to accept or reject; three give you something
// you can steer.
//
// The consequence that pays for the whole design: **an avatar costs no wire
// bytes.** The name already travels to the other device (LinkProtocol's Hello
// and Join carry it), so the far side rebuilds the face by reading the same
// three words. Nothing was added to the protocol, nothing can disagree, and a
// build with a different word list draws a plain head rather than the wrong
// face. See PlayerAvatar.h for that half.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The composing half is freestanding so host-tests can exercise the lists;
// only the load/save half touches storage.

//
// A full name is three words and up to twenty characters, which is right on a
// seat card and far too long anywhere it has to sit inside a line of prose.
// "SHAGGY SLEEPY GOATEE'S MOVE" is past the width of a status capsule, and
// what gets dropped is "MOVE" -- so the one word carrying the meaning of the
// label is the word that goes, silently, with no ellipsis. Battleship has the
// same shape in "%s SANK YOUR %s".
//
// Calling them SHAGGY is also just better. It is what a person would do, it can
// never overflow, and the full name is still on the screen where you met them.
//
// Copies up to the first space, truncating rather than overrunning. Works on a
// name this build cannot parse, since it reads the text and not the slots.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Two players called SPIKY, and why one word is still enough
//
// Fourteen hair words means two people share a first word about one time in
// fourteen, which sounds fatal for a label and is not. Every caller of this
// function passes the *opponent's* name; a player's own name is never drawn as
// a name, only as "YOU" and as their face. So a two-player screen has exactly
// one name on it, and one name cannot be ambiguous. Both being SPIKY is a
// coincidence you notice, not a question you have to answer.
//
// The face closes the rest: the three words *are* the avatar, and it sits
// beside the name in the capsule. Two Spikys have different eyes and mouths, so
// they are already told apart by the thing next to the word.
//
// **At three players this stops being true**. When several opponents are on one screen, the distinguishing
// word is no longer always the first, and the answer then is not a longer name
// but a narrower one: given the set of names in the room, take the shortest run
// of slots that separates them -- SPIKY, else SPIKY WINK, else all three. It is
// a pure function over a list of names and belongs here, next to this one,
// where host-tests/player can put every pair of the 2744 through it.
//
// It is deliberately not written yet. It needs the set of names in the room and
// a 1:1 session carries exactly one peer, so there is nothing to compute
// against until a session can hold three. Build it with that session, not
// before, and give it the seat order too: "the other SPIKY" needs to mean the
// same player on both devices.

// and two simulators started together have consecutive pids in the same
// millisecond, so they rolled the identical name, face and all. Hashing one
// side before it meets the other is the fix, and it is a pure function so the

// not go back to the one two taps ago. Stepping means fourteen taps is the whole
// list, the order is the one in PlayerName.cpp, and the word you just left is
// thirteen taps away rather than lost. It also needs no seed, so what a tap does
// is now a fact rather than a distribution.
