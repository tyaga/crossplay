  // to lose it, and there was no way to choose one -- you pulled the lever until
  // something acceptable came out. Tapping it now opens PLAYER, where the name
  // comes apart into three words you can steer. That screen is the fork's
  // System Settings, and this bar is its entrance.

  // difference between the two states is the only thing saying where you are,
  // and it is smaller than the ink of one letter. The list resumes on the page

// mid-page: an e-ink panel repaints the whole screen either way, and a page
// that always starts in the same place is one a thumb can learn.

// How many pages `itemCount` rows need. Beside pageFor because it is the same

// token set it does not have in loop()).

// The row that stands for `page`: its first one.
//
// A folder remembers the page it was left on, and it remembers it as a ROW,
// because a row survives things a page number does not. Rows per page is a
// property of the panel and the chrome -- the player bar costs one, the page bar
// costs another -- so a stored page number means a different set of games the
// first time a token moves, silently. A stored row is the same game either way,
// and pageFor() puts it back on whichever page now holds it.
//
// pageFor(rowForPage(p, n), n) == p for every page of every folder, which is the
// property that makes "come back to the page I was on" true rather than likely.

// The row a folder actually resumes on, given what it remembered and how many
// items it holds NOW.
//
// The two disagree when the registry has shrunk since: a game removed by a
// firmware update, and a card that outlives the firmware that wrote it. When
// the remembered row is past the end this pins it to the LAST row, so the
// folder opens on its LAST page.
//
// Last rather than first, deliberately. What was remembered was "near the end of
// this folder", and the nearest surviving place to that is the end, not the top;
// falling back to page one would throw away the only thing that was stored.
// Naming it here rather than leaving it to a clamp because a clamp that cannot
// produce the last page is exactly what made this area unpredictable before, and
// an unnamed rule cannot be tested.

// The page one step of `delta` away, wrapping at both ends. The one place a
// page key, a swipe and a pip tap all agree on what "next" means, so no route
// can move by a different amount than another -- one input, one page, and the
// same page whichever input it was.
//
// Wraps because there is no cursor to run off the end of, and a page key that
// stops working at the last page reads as a broken key. That argument holds
// where the screen has no legible page indicator to explain the stop; the shelf
// has one and takes pageStepClamped instead. Kept because Hacker News's story
// list steps through this.
int pageStep(int page, int pageCount, int delta);

// The same step, STOPPING at both ends rather than wrapping.
//
// A wrap is only safe when the user can see where it put them. Every page of a
// folder draws its rows at the same eight screen positions, so a page arrived at
// by accident looks exactly like the page that was wanted, and the next tap
// opens a different game. A cold tester walked forward off the last page and
// launched one game believing it was another -- forward from the last page is the
// one step nobody ever means, so it is the one step that does nothing.
//
// The far page stays one tap away on the page bar, which is the same one tap the
// wrap cost and is why the bar carries marks rather than arrows.
int pageStepClamped(int page, int pageCount, int delta);

// The body rect the list occupies. `hasPages` is what the page bar costs it, and
// it is a separate argument rather than derived because pagingFor has to ask
// this question both ways round to resolve the circularity. Shared with the
// builder so the two cannot disagree.
//
// `hasDeviceName` is a property of the FOLDER and not of the mode, which is
// what keeps the chooser showing the same games on the same page as the list it
// was opened from. Making the band appear because the chooser wanted somewhere
// to put its caption would have reflowed APPS, which has no player bar: ten
// rows browsing and nine choosing, so the row under your finger is a different
// app before you have touched anything. The caption goes in the band the folder
// already has, or it does not go anywhere.
