// Everything a game needs to become multiplayer, and nothing else.
//
// This is the layer the whole exercise is about. LinkSession is a good radio
// protocol and a bad thing to hand a game author: it offers a raw address, the
// word "host", six protocol timing constants and the entire wire format, and it
// leaves the searching screen, the disconnect dialog, the sleep suppression and
// the receive/submit ordering as five separate things you can get wrong. The DS
// did not work that way. Every DS game connected identically because no game was
// allowed to write that part, and this file is the local equivalent.
//
// What a game writes:
//
//   struct Board { ... };                  // trivially copyable, <= 192 bytes
//   linkplay::Play<Board> play_;
//
//   play_.start(linkplay::GameId::Battleship, "MARIO");
//
//   switch (play_.update(millis())) {
//     case Phase::Searching:  break;                        // chrome draws it
//     case Phase::TheirTurn:  if (play_.takeOpponent(board_)) redraw(); break;
//     case Phase::YourTurn:   if (moved) play_.play(board_); break;
//     case Phase::Over:       break;                        // chrome draws it
//     case Phase::Off:        break;
//   }
//
// That is the whole API. No packets, no addresses, no channel, no timeouts, no
// host, no lobby, and nothing for the player to decide either: they tap
// MULTIPLAYER and the next thing they see is a board.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What this layer makes impossible, rather than merely documented.
//
// - You cannot move on a stale board. Phase is TheirTurn until you have taken
//   delivery of their move, so YourTurn structurally implies "nothing pending".
//   Forgetting takeOpponent() leaves you visibly stuck on their turn instead of
//   quietly desyncing, and it says so in the log.
// - You cannot mis-size the buffer. The state is a type, not a pointer and a
//   capacity, so a mismatch is a compile error.
// - You cannot forget to suppress sleep. wantsAwake() is true for a whole match,
//   and LinkActivity returns it from preventAutoSleep(). Waiting for an opponent
//   to think looks exactly like inactivity to the sleep timer.
// - You cannot leave the radio on. stop() is idempotent and the destructor calls
//   it.
