// The half of multiplayer that is the same in every game.
//
// LinkPlay handles the radio and LinkScreens draws the two seats, and between
// them there is still a match's worth of behaviour: when to start looking, how
// a rematch is asked and answered, which screen owns the pass, what a seat
// says, when to keep the device awake. A rematch conversation that two games
// implement separately is a rematch conversation that will eventually work
// differently in each.
//
// So this is where the DS's uniformity is enforced rather than hoped for. A
// game inherits, fills in what only it can know, and gets everything else --
// including every screen -- for free.
//
// What a game must supply:
//
//   linkState()        the Play<State> it owns
//   linkGameTitle()    "BATTLESHIP"
//   linkHeadline()     why the link screen is up, in the player's words
//   onMatchStart()     a fresh game, and which side you are
//   takeOpponentState()  adopt their state into yours, however that merges
//   onRematch()        both sides said yes
//   onLinkEnded()      back to solo: restore what was saved
//   matchGameOver()    whether the game has finished
//   onMatchEnded()     it just finished: count it and put the final board up
//   gameLoop() / gameRender()   what loop() and render() used to be
//
// What it must NOT write: the searching screen, the disconnect screen, the
// rematch screen, the note vocabulary, the seat states, the tick, or the sleep
// suppression.
//
// Note this is the one file under link/ that is not freestanding: it inherits
// from Activity and therefore reaches the renderer and the input manager. Keep
// it out of host-tests/link/run.sh, which compiles the rest with nothing but a
// C++17 toolchain on purpose.
