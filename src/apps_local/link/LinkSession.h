#pragma once

// A two-player match over a local radio, with no server, no router, no lobby
// and nothing for the user to configure. Tap MULTIPLAYER, and the next thing
// you see is a board.
//
// Freestanding: no Arduino, no renderer, no storage. Time arrives as an
// argument rather than being read from millis(), so host-tests/link/ can play
// thousands of matches deterministically.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Three decisions carry the whole design.
//
// 1. THE PAYLOAD IS THE WHOLE SHARED STATE, NOT THE MOVE.
//    A battleship game is 52 bytes against a 192-byte packet, so the entire
//    game fits in one packet with room to spare. Once you send whole states,
//    the two devices cannot disagree: there is no move log to replay, no
//    ordering to get right, and a lost packet is a stale frame that the next
//    one corrects rather than a desync. Nintendo could not do this at 60fps.
//    Board games are small enough that we get it for free.
//
//    "Shared" is the game's call. Battleship keeps each player's ships local
//    and shares only the hit grid; the session moves an opaque blob and does
//    not care.
//
// 2. TURNS STRICTLY ALTERNATE, AND THE HOST GOES FIRST.
//    Only the side whose turn it is produces a new state, so a single sequence
//    number is enough and two writers can never race. Host is elected by lower
//    address, which both sides compute identically with no negotiation, which
//    is why the user never sees the word "host".
//
// 3. A MATCH LIVES ONLY WHILE BOTH APPS ARE OPEN.
//    Leaving the app or locking the device ends it, and the other side is told
//    immediately by a Bye rather than waiting out the silence timeout. There is
//    no resume, no reconnect, and nothing is written to the card.
