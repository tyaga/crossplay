// The end of a match: what happens between the last move and ANOTHER GAME?
//
// Two things went wrong at that instant, and it is the same instant, which is
// why they are one file.
//
// The loser never saw the move that beat them. driveLink() applied the winning
// state and put the rematch screen up in the same pass, and a repaint is
// deferred to the end of the loop, so the board carrying the win was never on
// the panel at all. Losing without seeing how is the worst version of losing.
//
// And a game that records its result inside gameLoop() -- in an arm after a
// guard that returns first in multiplayer, or in a block gameLoop() stops
// reaching -- never counts a link match: the tally, the final board and the
// whole W/L/D record exist only for solo games. Nothing crashes and nothing
// logs: the record is simply never written.
//
// Ask what a Nintendo DS would do. It shows the winning move, lets it sit long
// enough to read, and only then offers another game -- and it counts the match
// while it is doing that. So both live here, driven by the layer, rather than
// in nine games that would each get it slightly differently.
//
// Freestanding on purpose -- <atomic> and <cstdint> and nothing else -- so
// host-tests/link can drive the whole sequence with no renderer, no device and
// no radio. Everything that has an ORDER to get wrong is inside update(),
// rather than spread across the caller where a test would have to reproduce it
// and could reproduce it wrongly. The host is a template parameter rather than
// a base class for the same reason a vtable is not free here; it must supply:
//
//   bool matchGameOver() const   has the game finished
//   void onMatchEnded()          count it, and show it: called exactly ONCE
//                                per finished match, and it is the only place
//                                a link match is ever recorded
//   void onEndgameChanged()      repaint
//
// On tasks: update(), reset() and skip() belong to the LOOP task, notePainted()
// to the RENDER task, and only the timestamp crosses between them, atomically.
// The stage byte is written by the loop and read by the render task through
// showingFinal(), the same way requested_ and rematch_ already are in
// LinkActivity: a single byte, and a stale read costs one frame.
