// The multiplayer screens, written once and shared by every game.
//
// This is where the DS's uniformity actually lived. Its games all connected
// identically not because the radio made them, but because no game was allowed
// to write this part. If each game drew its own searching screen, the abstraction underneath would still be correct and
// the feeling would still be gone.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One screen, not three.
//
// Searching, "they left", and "shall we play again" are the same picture in
// different states: two seats and the link between them. Giving them one
// builder is not tidiness -- it is what makes the transitions read as one
// object changing rather than three screens replacing each other, which is the
// only kind of motion an e-ink panel can afford.
//
// The seats are the ornament, and they obey the rule: made of the system's own
// material (a match is two seats) and carrying its own data (who is in them and
// what they have just decided). The rail down the left is the link itself --
// dithered while there is nobody on the other end, solid once there is. That is
// the one thing on the screen worth watching, so it is the thing that changes.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Freestanding builders: a model in, a drawn frame out, no renderer and no Activity, so host-tests/ui/ can assert what
// they drew and what they made tappable.

// were playing vanished the moment you started playing them -- which is exactly
// backwards, since the whole point of a face is knowing who is on the other
// end. The capsule already names them; this is the same thought, drawn.
//
// Shared rather than copied into each game for the reason every screen in this
// directory is shared: two games that placed it differently would look like two
// devices. A null or empty name returns `band` untouched, which is what solo
// play against the engine gets -- there is nobody to show.
//
// Drawn in ink: the band is page background, and the capsule that follows is

// finished belongs: it is the one thing worth looking at while deciding whether
// to play again, and it is what turned this zone from slack into content.
//
// The layer cannot draw it -- a board is the game's material, not the link's -- so
// it hands over a slot and stays out of it, the same split the board screen
