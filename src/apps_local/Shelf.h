// The shelf: everything this fork adds to the device, and the only way in or
// out of it.
//
// Home gets the Home items, launched directly, and one folder row, APPS &
// GAMES, holding everything else -- upstream's file browser included. That is
// the whole hierarchy.
//
//   Home
//     Library / File Transfer                          (upstream's)
//     Study                                            (Home item)
//     Apps & Games >  browse files, reading, hacker news, ..., battleship
//     Settings                                         (upstream's)
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Three rules, and the reason each exists.
//
// 1. A folder holds apps, never another folder. Depth is capped at two by the
//    type, not by discipline: there is nowhere in `Folder` to put a folder.
//    Two taps reaches anything, forever, and on a panel that repaints in half a
//    second a third tap is a real cost.
//
// 2. Games and apps are the same kind of row. The only difference between
//    solitaire and a spaced-repetition deck is where it sits, so there is one
//    `Item` type and one launcher.
//
// 3. An app never knows where it came from. It calls leave() and lands in its
//    folder, or on Home when Home opened it; a folder calls leave() and lands
//    on Home. Upstream's screens in a folder cannot call leave(): they call
//    goHome(), and goHome() asks leaveToFolder() first.
