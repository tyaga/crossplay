#pragma once

// Battleship rules and a gunner, freestanding.
//
// No Arduino, no renderer, no heap, no allocation of any kind: the whole game
// is 52 bytes of plain struct, so host-tests/battleship/ runs the rules on a
// laptop in milliseconds and host-tests/link/ can play whole games between two
// simulated devices. Only BattleshipActivity draws.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The state is the wire format, deliberately.
//
// Battleship has no text notation for a position, so `Game` itself is what
// travels: it is
// trivially copyable, it is 52 bytes against the link's 192-byte packet, and
// making it the wire format means there is exactly one description of a game in
// this app instead of two that can drift.
//
// Everything that can be derived is derived rather than stored -- who has won,
// whether a ship is sunk, whether the fleets are placed. A stored winner is a
// field two devices can disagree about; a computed one cannot be.
//
// `Game` holds BOTH fleets, including the one its owner must not see. That is
// the only shape that keeps whole-state-not-moves (and with it, desync being
// structurally impossible), and it is safe for the same reason the rest of this
// works: a match is two X4 Pros in the same room running the same build. The
// secret is kept by the drawing code, which never asks the opposing fleet where
// it is until the game is over. See BattleshipActivity::drawTargetGrid.

// parity lattice because no ship is shorter than two cells, which halves the
// board it has to cover.
//
// Stateless on purpose. Everything it knows is on the board it can see, so
// there is no gunner state to save, to restore, or to keep in step with a
// position that arrived from another device -- the last of which is what makes
// this the same function in single player and in a match.
//
// The one thing it knows that a person would have to work out: a hit belonging
// to an already-sunk ship is finished business. A human is told "you sank my
// cruiser" and usually deduces which run of hits that was; the gunner reads it
// off the fleet. That is a real advantage in the ambiguous cases and it is the
// only one it has.
