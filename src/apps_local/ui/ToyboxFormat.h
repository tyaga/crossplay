// How wide a snprintf buffer has to be, derived rather than guessed.
//
// A tile must show the whole text, no exceptions. snprintf does not overrun --
// it CUTS -- so a buffer that is one byte short is not a crash, it is a
// shortened string on the panel with nothing to say it was shortened. That is
// exactly the defect these constants exist to prevent, and card 256 found it
// twenty-two times over twelve apps, every one of them a number that looked
// roomy at the time it was typed.
//
// So: size a buffer as (the ints it can carry * kIntChars) + the format's own
// literal characters + the terminator. Written that way the size IS the
// derivation, so changing the format changes the buffer, and a format that
// outgrows its buffer stops compiling instead of quietly truncating.
//
// The class was invisible on this Mac entirely: clang has no
// -Wformat-truncation in any form, and the three GCC suites that could have
// seen it all passed -Wno-format-truncation. Those flags are gone; keep them
// gone. See host-tests/ui/run.sh, and card 270 for the -O level it still needs.
//
// Freestanding, like the rest of ui/: no renderer, no device, no Arduino.
