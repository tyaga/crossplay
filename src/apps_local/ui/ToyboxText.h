// Fitting somebody else's words into a box this panel actually has.
//
// One function, and it is here rather than in an app because the rule it
// encodes is the fork's, not any app's: shrink to fit, break on a space, and
// say that something was dropped. The component clips instead, so a headline
// too long for its rows is simply chopped -- the Hacker News front page read
// "Show HN: Simple algorithm and colo" and "I am retiring from fulltime
// writing (" until this existed. A word broken in half looks like a rendering
// fault, which is the one thing Mario rejects on sight.
//
// Header-only so that adopting it costs no build-file edit in any of the
// twelve places that compile screens.
//
// Hacker News wrote it first and still calls it through a one-line wrapper, so
// there is one implementation and its tests did not have to move.

// The fork's own type ladder, in one place.
//
// ToyboxFonts.h states the rule in prose:
// "pick the largest cut it fits in, walking the available cuts down, and only
// break a word when the smallest still overflows." This is that function. A
// screen without it hands its title straight to a component that cuts rather
// than shrinks, and "CURSED CEMETERY" reaches a panel as "CURSED CEMETER": not
// a wrapped line and not an ellipsis, a name with its last letter gone.
//
// THE RUNGS ARE ORDERED BY WHAT THE FACE MEASURES, never by what the slot is
// called, and that is the bug all six hand-rolled ladders share. Each of them
// walks TITLE, then BODY, then SMALL, which is only descending while an app
// binds descending cuts. bigNumberFaces() puts the 64px cut in BODY and the
// 30px one in TITLE; cardFaces() puts 44 in SMALL, 30 in BODY and 64 in TITLE.
// Walked by name on either of those, the "step down" steps UP into a face twice
// the size of the one it was asked to shrink. Asked of lineHeight() it cannot:
// the ladder is whatever this screen really bound, sorted.
//
// Never above the cut the caller already chose, either. A title asked for at
// the UI cut must not come back at the display cut because the display cut
// happens to fit too -- fitting is a licence to get SMALLER and nothing else.
//
// Rewrites `style.font` to the chosen cut and returns the string to draw, which
// is `text` itself whenever a rung fitted. Only when the smallest still
// overflows does it fall through to fitLines() above: a word boundary and an
// ellipsis the cut can really draw, never a silent cut mid-word.
