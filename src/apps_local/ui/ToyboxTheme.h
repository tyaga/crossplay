// Which typefaces a screen speaks in.
//
// Toybox is the shapes -- the black header band, the pill buttons, the hairline
// rows, the proportions -- and those stay shared so the apps read as one system.
// The faces do not: a game gets its own, so you can tell what you are playing
// from across the room without reading a word.
//
// Three slots exist (GfxRendererTarget::FONT_SLOTS), so a game picks three:
// `small` is the dense cut for tiles, `body` is rows and labels, `title` is the
// header band.
struct Faces {
  int small = kTileFontId;
  int body = kUiFontId;
  int title = kDisplayFontId;
};

// Jersey throughout: the fork's default, used by the shelf and the games.
inline Faces toyboxFaces() { return Faces{}; }

// For an app whose own surface is a page of prose. The body slot steps down to
// the reading cut so a screenful is a screenful rather than a paragraph; the
// header band keeps the display cut, because the top bar is the fork's chrome
// and a shared one is what makes two apps feel like one device.
inline Faces readingFaces() { return Faces{kTileFontId, kReadingFontId, kDisplayFontId}; }
// Same, for a screen with buttons on it. A button is the device speaking rather
// than the app, so it keeps Jersey; the small slot carries it, because three
// slots is a working set and a list's dense footnote cut and a footer's button
// cut are never wanted on the same screen. Rebinding is one assignment.
inline Faces readingChromeFaces() { return Faces{kButtonFontId, kReadingFontId, kDisplayFontId}; }
// Same again, for a screen whose body carries ONE STRING that has to be read off
// the glass and typed -- an address, a code. The small slot takes the bold
// reading cut so that string has somewhere to land that is neither the display
// cut (which no address fits: a worst-case IPv4 URL measures 632 against a
// 448px body) nor the same serif 14 as the paragraph under it. Without this the
// fitting ladder steps the headline, the address, the prose and the footer all
// onto the identical cut, and the one line the reader has to copy is the third
// line of a paragraph.
inline Faces readingAddressFaces() { return Faces{kReadingBoldFontId, kReadingFontId, kDisplayFontId}; }

// A pairing screen whose one string is a CODE somebody reads down a telephone.
// The small slot takes the huge cut, which is the same trick readingAddressFaces
// plays one rung lower: the thing that has to be read from across a table gets a
// cut of its own, and everything else keeps the reading face it deserves.
//
// The huge cut goes in SMALL and not in BODY on purpose. themeTokens() binds
// BOTH bodyText and smallText to FONT_SLOT_BODY, so a screen that puts an 82px
// capital there gets it as the DEFAULT for every string that does not ask for
// something else -- one forgotten style and a sentence is drawn four lines tall.
// In SMALL it is opt-in: nothing resolves to it unless a style names it.
inline Faces pairingCodeFaces() { return Faces{kHugeFontId, kReadingFontId, kDisplayFontId}; }

// And for a screen whose header band carries a story's title rather than the
// app's name: the title slot takes the bold reading cut so a whole headline
// fits and still reads as a headline, and the SMALL slot takes the small
// reading cut so a headline too long for the bold cut steps DOWN through real
// reading faces (bold 16 -> 14 -> 11) rather than falling straight to an
// ellipsis. The step used to be the Jersey tile cut (kButtonFontId), which is
// a pixel display face with no business setting prose -- so a long headline was
// either cut at reading_serif_14 or shrunk into a 21px Jersey line box, and the
// fork's own shrink rule had nothing worth stepping down to (card #268). The
// app's own name stays in the display cut on the screen where it *is* the
// title, which is the front page.
inline Faces readerFaces() { return Faces{kReadingSmallFontId, kReadingFontId, kReadingBoldFontId}; }

// A screen whose content is ONE WORD, sized to be read across a room. All three
// slots carry a different size of the same face, largest in the title slot,
// because the card picks the biggest cut the word fits in and a freestanding
// builder has no way to ask for a rebind mid-layout: whatever it can measure is
// whatever is bound. The 30px cut doubles as this screen's chrome face, which
// is why there is no UI cut here and no need for one -- the only other text is
// two edge labels and a score.
inline Faces cardFaces() { return Faces{kLargeFontId, kDisplayFontId, kHugeFontId}; }

// A front door with a secondary line under its headline and a record line under
// the rule. Both are sentences rather than labels, and at the 20px UI cut a
// sentence runs off a 480px panel and is truncated with an ellipsis Jersey does
// not carry -- so it draws as nothing and the line simply stops. The small slot
// takes the button cut, which fits about half again as much.
inline Faces proseMenuFaces() { return Faces{kButtonFontId, kUiFontId, kDisplayFontId}; }

// A results screen: a header band, a list of words, and one very large number.
// The title slot stays the display cut so the band is not clipped by a face
// meant for a card; the huge cut goes in the BODY slot, which is the only slot
// the score needs, and the list takes the UI cut in the small slot.
