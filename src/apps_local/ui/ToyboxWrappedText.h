// A long document, wrapped once and read from many times.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The bug this exists for.
//
// A reader drawing one page of a long article used to wrap the WHOLE article
// twice on every paint: once through fui::textAreaMeasure(), for the line
// count the pager needs, and once inside fui::textArea(), which walks from
// byte zero to find the twenty lines it is going to draw. A wrap is not cheap
// -- it asks the font for the width of every candidate prefix, so it costs
// bytes x line length -- and both walks are on the render path. Mario reported
// the shape of it from real use before anyone measured it: a long article
// takes a long time to OPEN, and every page turn pays exactly the same again.
//
// So: wrap once per opening, keep a sparse index of where the lines start, and
// let a page turn walk only the window it draws.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The dangerous half is not the speed, it is the staleness.
//
// The line count is not decoration. A reading position is the top line over
// the total, and the page label and forward control are drawn from it. A count
// kept from a wrap that no longer describes the panel -- a rotation, a bigger
// reading size, a different cut installed off the SD card -- would be a wrong
// position, and there would be nothing on screen to say so. A cache
// that goes stale here is worse than the slowness it removes.
//
// Two layers stop it, and neither is a list of things somebody thought of.
//
// 1. THE KEY IS PROBED, NOT ENUMERATED. The wrap reads the outside world
//    through exactly one door: target.measureText(style.font, ., style). So
//    the key fingerprints THAT FUNCTION, asked about THIS DOCUMENT'S OWN
//    ALPHABET -- every distinct character the document is written in, measured
//    one at a time, and then all of them together so a change in kerning moves
//    it too. Anything that changes what the door returns changes the key,
//    including causes this file has never heard of: a font size setting, a cut
//    swapped in at runtime, a TextStyle field the SDK grows next year. Keying
//    on `font` and `width` would have been the enumeration, and enumeration is
//    what fails silently here.
//
//    The alphabet is collected when the document is wrapped, not on every
//    paint, because the text cannot change without the content hash changing
//    -- and that is in the key too.
//
// 2. THE INDEX CHECKS ITSELF AGAINST THE DOCUMENT. Drawing a window starts one
//    checkpoint BELOW the one it needs and walks into it, so the walk that
//    draws is also a walk that can DISAGREE -- and what it compares is WHERE
//    EVERY CHECKPOINT IT PASSES THROUGH FALLS, not how many lines came out.
//    Any checkpoint landing on a byte the index did not record means the index
//    is describing a panel this is not, and it is thrown away before anything
//    is drawn. The extra stride is the whole cost, and it is what makes the
//    window's own starting byte checkable instead of assumed.
//
//    It compared the COUNT until a review caught it. A change of cut that adds
//    a line to one paragraph and takes one from the next leaves the count of a
//    stretch exactly as it was while the byte recorded for a line inside it
//    stops being the start of a line at all -- so the page was drawn from the
//    middle of a word and the check said everything was fine. Two pages of a
//    test document, silently. A count is a proxy for where the breaks fall;
//    this now checks where the breaks fall.
//
// WHAT IS STILL NOT COVERED, stated plainly rather than talked around:
//
//   - Layer 1's fingerprint measures the document's characters one at a time
//     and then all of them run together. It cannot see a change that moves
//     only a PAIR that does not occur in that run -- kerning. Layer 2 catches
//     such a change once it disturbs a checkpoint the window passes through,
//     which is one paint later at worst and only where the reader is looking.
//
//   - A CHANGE CONFINED TO AN EARLIER PART OF THE DOCUMENT IS INVISIBLE HERE,
//     and this is the real limit rather than a corner. If the cut changes the
//     width of something on line 30 and nothing after it, then from line 40
//     onward the wrap is locally IDENTICAL to the one the index recorded:
//     every byte the index holds is still a line start, every stretch still
//     holds the number of lines it held, and the walk agrees with itself
//     perfectly. What actually moved is the line NUMBER of everything after
//     line 30, which cannot be discovered without walking from byte zero --
//     which is the cost this whole file exists to avoid. Only layer 1 can
//     trigger a rebuild for that, so layer 1 is the one that has to be right;
//     layer 2 is a net under the window, not a second opinion on the document.
//     Confirmed by construction, not assumed: a test that hunted for this case
//     found it, and no check here fires on it.
//
//   - The byte comparison is belt and braces. Every case reachable in testing
//     is already caught by starting a stride lower and counting, because a
//     walk entering from a sound anchor reproduces the true wrap. Kept because
//     it is three lines and an integer compare on a path where being wrong
//     sends a wrong number to somebody's account -- but NO TEST FAILS WITHOUT
//     IT, and that is worth knowing before trusting it. What closes the bug it
//     was written for is the extra stride.
//
//   - WHAT ACTUALLY HOLDS THIS SHUT TODAY IS NOT THE KEY. The reading cut is
//     compiled in: kReadingFontId resolves to reading_serif_14 through
//     renderer.insertFont() at boot, and there is no runtime path that changes
//     it. So pair kerning cannot move mid-session and the gap above is not
//     reachable in this firmware. IF THE READER BODY IS EVER SET IN A CUT
//     LOADED FROM THE SD CARD -- the motivating example three paragraphs up --
//     that stops being true, and layer 1 needs to fingerprint pairs rather
//     than characters before it is.
//
// Disagreement costs a rebuild, never a wrong page. And a rebuild changes the
// line count, so whoever asked for that count has to ask again AFTER the
// drawing, or it holds a position computed against the wrong length. That is
// the property to preserve if this is ever changed.
