// Which shelf items the folders do not show, as a pure set plus a parse/format
// pair.
//
// Split out of Shelf.cpp for the same reason ShelfState is: the file outlives
// the firmware that wrote it, so the part that has to survive a truncated
// write, a game renamed since, and a card written by a newer build is the part
// a host test must be able to reach without a device. See
// host-tests/shelfhidden/.
//
// The file is /.crosspoint/shelf-hidden.cfg and is one item TITLE per line:
//
//   SOLITAIRE
//   XKCD
//
// Only the hidden ones are written, so the common file is empty or absent and
// the common parse is nothing at all.
//
// Keyed by TITLE and not by row index, for the reason the wake-resume already
// learned: indices move whenever a game is added or removed, and this card
// outlives firmware updates. An index would hide a DIFFERENT game after the
// next release, silently, and the person it happened to would have no way to
// tell what had gone wrong.
//
// A title in the file that matches no item today is kept rather than dropped.
// That is what makes a downgrade safe: a build that does not know about a game
// must not be the reason its setting is forgotten by the build after it.
//
// THE WHOLE FORMAT FAILS OPEN. A file that is missing, empty, truncated
// mid-line, or full of junk hides nothing, because hiding is what the lines
// SAY and a line that says nothing recognisable hides nothing recognisable.
// That direction is the one that matters: a game that appears when it should
// not is a list a person can fix in four taps, and a game that vanishes for a
// reason held in a file they cannot see is a device that broke.

// A folder's rows, given what it is hiding.
//
// A ROW is a position in the list a folder is drawing; an ITEM is a position in
// the registry. They are the same number until something is hidden, and after
// that they are two small ints in the same range that nothing distinguishes --
// so crossing them is a mistake no compiler and no range check can report, and
// the symptom is the shelf's oldest one: the header says page 2, the rows sit
// where page 2's rows sit, and the tap opens page 1's game.
//
// They live HERE, away from the registry, because the registry drags in every
// activity in the fork and cannot be built on a host. The three functions below
// are the whole conversion and they take the titles as a callable, so the
// folder passes its own and a test passes an array. See host-tests/shelfhidden.
