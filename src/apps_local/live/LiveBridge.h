// moved, or a reader carried to another house, none of which this service can
// tell apart. If the call does not get out, the fridge simply goes quiet and

// is (it is the interval in its own reply), but not whether somebody has
// switched Live off since the last one.
//
// `batteryPercent` goes out as X-Battery for the same reason: nobody can ask a
// sleeping reader, and a call of its own would double what a wake costs. The
// caller reads it BEFORE the radio comes up. -1 is a gauge that could not be
// read, and sends no header rather than a 0%.
//
// The reader deliberately does NOT report its own alarm. It cannot: the
// headers are composed before the reply is read, and a pull the reader gets an
// answer to clears its failures and makes it adopt the interval in that reply,
// so any figure sent here is the alarm for the state it was in BEFORE the
// request. Sending one made the website count down to moments the reader was
// never going to wake at.

// On 200 the body is written to `destPath`, bounded by kMaxImageBytes and then
// judged by its own BMP header rather than by a magic length: a short write is
// how a half-arrived image reaches the glass, and the image has more than one
// valid size. On 304 and 204 NOTHING is written and nothing is repainted: that
// is the wake this whole design is built around, and a card write on it would

// The sleep screen is not one bit. The X4 Pro's panel driver declares

// path, so the device's own format is 2bpp four-level: 480x800 at two bits is
// 96000 bytes of pixels over a 70-byte header and palette. The one-bit file
// (48062) is the other thing the same reader handles, and lib/GfxRenderer's
// Bitmap takes 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 32.
//
// So this bounds the DOWNLOAD -- a runaway response must not fill the card --
// and live::bmpIsComplete decides whether what arrived is a whole picture.
// Bounding by an exact size instead would refuse the format the panel actually
// wants the moment the website started sending it.
