// Live's arithmetic, with nothing in it that needs a card, a radio or a panel.
//
// Everything here is a decision the device makes with the power off in front of
// it: when to wake, how long to wait after a failure, and whether the number a
// server handed it is one it is allowed to believe. All of it is testable on a
// laptop (host-tests/live), which is the only way the backoff can be proved --
// the failure it exists to prevent takes three weeks of real time to observe.
//
// The engine that uses these lives in LiveEngine; the card in LiveStore.

//
// The server answers X-Next-Wake on every /api/pull, including 304 and 204, and
// the website is where it is changed. The device clamps it because a header is
// an input: a zero or a negative would busy-wake the radio flat in a night, and
// a number past a week is indistinguishable from Live being off while still
// costing a wake to discover.

// THE SERVICE'S OWN DEFAULT, matched deliberately (store.DEFAULT_INTERVAL_S).
//
// It was six hours against the service's day. Nothing on either side could
// have noticed: this is the interval a reader runs on until the service has
// ever spoken to it, so the two numbers describe one fact and never meet.
// host-tests/live generates the service's three limits out of store.py and
// fails if either side moves.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What a failure costs, and why the retry is not a retry loop.
//
// A wake that cannot reach the service still pays for itself: the radio comes
// up, DevMode's join allows 20 seconds before it gives up, and the request on
// top of that. Call it 25 seconds at ~80mA, which is ~0.55mAh per failed wake.
//
// Retrying every 15 minutes is 96 failures a day, ~53mAh/day. An X4 Pro cell is
// ~1100mAh, so a device whose Wi-Fi password changed while its owner was away
// is flat in under three weeks having done nothing at all -- and the owner's
// first evidence is a device that will not turn on (see the
// devmode-flattens-the-battery memory; this is the same failure with a
// different cause).
//
// So the delay doubles from 15 minutes and stops at a day: 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h,
// 4h, 8h, 16h, then 24h forever. The whole of a first bad week costs about
// 6mAh, and a device that stays unreachable settles at one wake a day, which is
// under 0.6mAh/day -- less than the sleep floor itself.
//
// The cap is a day rather than "give up" on purpose: giving up means a device
// that never comes back when the router does, and the only way a user could
// tell is by finding this setting again.
constexpr uint32_t kFirstRetrySeconds = 15 * 60;
constexpr uint32_t kMaxRetrySeconds = 24 * 3600;

// `consecutiveFailures` counts the failures BEFORE this delay: 1 after the
// first, so the first retry is kFirstRetrySeconds. 0 or less is not a failure
// and returns 0, which no caller should be asking for -- it is the identity
// rather than a clamp, so a miscount shows up as an immediate retry in a test
// rather than as a silent 15-minute one in the field.

// Is the clock worth believing?
//
// The ESP32 keeps its system clock across deep sleep on the RTC, and Live sets
// that clock from X-Server-Time on every successful pull. Before the first one
// there is nothing to set it from, and a cold boot starts at the epoch.
//
// A schedule computed against a 1970 clock is not conservative, it is wrong in
// the expensive direction: every sleep looks overdue and every sleep spends the
// radio. So an implausible clock is treated as "no clock", and the engine falls
// back to fetching once and then trusting the timer.

//
// It arrives quoted (`"3f1c..."`) and is compared UNQUOTED, which is what the
// service does with the If-None-Match it receives. Storing the quotes makes
// every comparison fail and every wake download the same image again -- the
// exact cost the header exists to avoid, and invisible from the outside because
// the picture on the glass would still be right.
//

// The battery, as a pull reports it.
//
// X-Battery carries a whole percent and ONLY a real one. A gauge that could not
// be read is -1 here and no header at all on the wire: sent as "0" it would
// reach the website as a flat battery, a confident number that sends somebody
// across town with a charger for a reader that is fine.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Did the whole picture arrive?
//
// Live's images are BMPs the website makes, and their SIZE IS NOT FIXED: the
// X4 Pro's sleep screen is not one bit. The panel driver declares AbsolutePlanes
// grayscale and renderCustomSleepScreen takes the grayscale path, so the
// device's own format is 2bpp four-level (96070 bytes at 480x800) and the
// one-bit file (48062) is merely the other thing it reads. lib/GfxRenderer's
// Bitmap reader handles 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 32.
//
// So the download cannot be bounded by a magic number. A BMP declares its own
// total length in bytes 2..5, and comparing that with what actually arrived
// catches a truncated download at ANY colour depth -- including depths this
// firmware has not met yet. A constant would have to be revisited every time
// the website learns a new one, and the revision that gets forgotten ships a
// torn picture to a fridge.

// "12 Sep": when a phone was let in, in the only precision this device earns.
//
// The service stamps every sender with an epoch. The screen has one short row
// per sender and the question it answers is "how long has this person had
// access", so a day and a month is the whole of it -- a time of day would be a
// figure nobody reads and a year would be one nobody needs while the service is
// months old.
//
// An epoch below kPlausibleEpochFloor comes back EMPTY rather than as
// "01 Jan". A reader that has never had a clock is not a reader that was paired
// in 1970, and a date printed from a zero is a fact the screen would be
// inventing. The row draws the name alone in that case, which is the truth.
//
// UTC, deliberately and without apology: the device's only clock source is

  // whenever the schedule changed or a check was missed: set 07:00 at four in

// by construction and needs no clock to prove it.
//
// That distinction is load-bearing rather than tidy. Live sets its clock from
// X-Server-Time and nothing else, so a device whose battery went flat comes
// back with a token, no clock, and no way to measure elapsed time. Without this
// parameter the no-clock branch had to fetch on EVERY sleep to avoid missing
// the schedule -- which, on a device that also cannot reach the service, is a
// fetch every time its owner puts it down, with the backoff bypassed in exactly
// the situation the backoff exists for. The RTC timer keeps counting correctly
// with no wall clock at all, so it can carry the schedule on its own and the

// The two lines the Live screen leads with.
//
// "In about 24 hours" over "Every 24 hours" was the screen saying one fact
// twice, and it was not a wording problem: the next check was printed from the
// INTERVAL, so a reader that checked one minute ago and a reader that checked
// twenty-three hours ago put the same headline on the glass. It is computed
// from `decide` now -- the same arithmetic the sleep path runs, backoff
// included -- so the biggest thing on the screen cannot promise a check the
// schedule is not about to make.
//
// The answers, shortest first, and every one of them fits the display cut
// across a 448px body (measured, not assumed -- "In about 45 minutes" is 464px
// there and would have silently dropped the headline a rung):
//
//   ""                not paired; the caller draws the code screen instead
//   "Paused"          the toggle is off, so there is no next check to name
//   "When it sleeps"  the check is due: nothing has been asked yet, there is
//                     no clock to measure with, or the moment has passed
//   "Any moment"      inside the last three minutes of an armed timer
//   "In 45 minutes" / "In an hour" / "In 5 hours" / "In a day" / "In 2 days"
//
// "SOON" IS GONE and its absence is the point. It was the answer for a reader
// that had never checked in -- which is every reader for the first seconds
// after pairing, the moment somebody is watching hardest -- and it says
// nothing: not a figure, not a mechanism, not a gesture. The honest answer in
// that state is the mechanism, and it is the same one `decide` acts on: a
// reader only fetches on its way into sleep, so a check that is due happens
// the next time the device is put down. That is a thing the person holding it
// can do, which "Soon" was not.
//
// Minutes are rounded to five and never shown below five, which is the whole of
// this device's honesty about the figure: the sleep timer runs off an RC
// oscillator that drifts percent-level, a refresh taken on the way into sleep
// shifts the schedule, and a wake missed for want of Wi-Fi is invisible until
// the one after. A figure to the minute would be a number this device cannot
// keep; a figure that is visibly rounded says so without spending a word. The
// website spells the same figures out with "in about" in front, because it has
// the room and the panel does not.
std::string nextCheckPhrase(const Schedule& schedule, int64_t nowEpoch);

// The small line UNDER the headline, and it answers whatever the headline
// cannot. It takes the whole schedule rather than the interval alone because
// two of its three answers are not about the interval at all:
//
//   "Last check failed." / "3 checks failed."   while anything is failing
//   "Every 6 hours when on"                     while the toggle is off
//   "Every 6 hours"                             otherwise
//
// THE FAILING CASE IS THE REASON THIS TAKES A SCHEDULE. In backoff the headline
// is the RETRY -- "In 15 minutes" on a weekly cadence -- and with the interval
// printed underneath it, a reader that cannot reach the service showed "In 15
// minutes" over "Every week" and nothing anywhere saying why the two disagree.
// That reads as broken, or as lying, and it is neither.
//
// THE STOPPED CASE IS A CONTRADICTION OTHERWISE. "Paused" over "Every 6 hours"
// is the screen saying it is not checking and then naming how often it checks:
// the same defect this layout was built to remove, one line further down.
// "when on" makes it a setting rather than a schedule.
//
// Days and weeks as well as hours, because the cap IS a week and "Every 168
// hours" is a number nobody reads.
