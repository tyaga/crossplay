// The device half of the sync bridge (docs/apps/study-sync-bridge-plan.md).
//
// Everything network lives here so StudyActivity only sequences screens. The
// protocol is the bridge's device API: QR pairing (start / poll / on-device
// confirm), then sync as one binary POST (this card's own revlog.dat tails
// and cards.dat, in the exact shapes it already writes), a polled job, and
// manifested deck downloads. Acks are byte offsets into revlog.dat; the file
// itself is never truncated.
//
// A download is checked against the manifest's LENGTH, not its sha256: the
// hash arrives and is parsed, and nothing on the device reads it. TLS covers
// the wire, so what this leaves open is a file that lands the right length
// and the wrong bytes on the card. Do not read the sha256 field as proof
// that something verified it.
//
// Two transports, split on FREEINK_NET_WOLFSSL:
//  - Device: freeink::SecureHttpClient with certificate verification against
//    a root BUNDLE (StudySyncRoots.h; SD override /study/.bridge-roots.pem),
//    because the bridge carries the account token and Cloudflare rotates
//    issuing CAs. setInsecure() is not used here, deliberately.
//  - Simulator: curl via popen. The sim's SecureHttpClient stub truncates a
//    binary body at the first NUL (String conversion), and the sync POST's
//    length prefix guarantees NULs, so the stub cannot carry it. In the sim
//    the bridge URL is overridable via STUDY_BRIDGE_URL so tests run against
//    a local bridge with a throwaway account, never a real one.
