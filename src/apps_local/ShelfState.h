// The shelf's remembered position, as a pure parse/format pair.
//
// Split out of Shelf.cpp so the file format can be tested on a host with no
// card and no device: the parse is the part that has to survive a truncated
// write, a file written by an older firmware, and a game that has since been
// renamed or removed. See host-tests/shelfstate/.
//
// The file is /.crosspoint/shelf.cfg and has one or two lines:
//
//   <lastFolder> <resumeRow0> <resumeRow1> ...
//   <title of the item that was open>
//
// The second line is what wake reads to return to the game you were in; it is
// absent when nothing was open, and absent in every file written before that
// existed. An older firmware reading a newer file stops after the first line
// and is unaffected, which is why the title went on a line of its own rather
// than at the end of the first.
//
// The item is keyed by TITLE and not by its row index. Indices move whenever a
// game is added or removed, and the file outlives firmware updates -- an index
// would silently resume into a different game.
//
// The resume value is an index and not a title for the opposite reason: it
// stands for a PAGE rather than for a game, and a page is a position in a list.
// See shelfui::rowForPage().
//
// It is the ITEM's index, not the row's, and the two stopped being the same
// number when a folder gained the ability to hide things: a row counts only
// what the folder is showing, and what it shows now is not what it showed when
// the file was written. shelf::resumeRowIn() converts on the way out and
// shelf::rememberRowIn() on the way in, so this file holds exactly one unit.

// longer exists. Pinning to the last row rather than to the first is the same
// choice shelfui::resumeRowFor() makes and for the same reason -- a folder that
// has shrunk under you reopens on its last page, which is nearer where you were
// than the top is. A title too long to hold is dropped rather than truncated --
// a truncated title matches no item, and dropping says so.
