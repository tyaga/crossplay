// The xkcd screens. Freestanding builders: a model in, a drawn frame out, no renderer and no Activity, so
// host-tests/ui/ can assert what they drew and what they made tappable.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// **Portrait, 480x800**, like every other app on the device, and the panel
// never rotates: a comic meant to be read sideways is stored already turned.
//
// The artwork arrives fitted to the panel width -- scaled once, on a host,
// with a real resampling filter, so the device blits 1:1 whatever it is
// handed. That is what leaves the page view with **one axis of motion**: down,
// half a screen at a time, snapped to a gap in the artwork.
//
// The 4% of comics that fit-to-width cannot render legible carry a second
// rendition, entered from the Confirm button. It is the only place a
// horizontal axis exists, and it is always exactly two columns. See
// XkcdCore.h for why none of this is decided by measuring the artwork.
//
// The reader is the one screen that is mostly not a screen: the comic is the
// app's own surface and the Activity blits it. What lives here is the bar under it. `readerViewport()` is shared
// between the two so the rect that gets drawn and the rect that gets tapped
// are the same rect -- the rule that has caught more bugs in this fork than
// any other.
