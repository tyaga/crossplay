// Klondike solitaire, as pure rules.
//
// Freestanding: no renderer, no storage, no Arduino. Everything here is decided by looking at the state
// and nothing here can draw, which is what lets host-tests/solitaire/ deal
// thousands of games and check every move without a device.
//
// Card encoding is one byte:
//
//   bits 0-3   rank, 0 = ace .. 12 = king
//   bits 4-5   suit
//   bit 7      face up
//
// so a card is comparable, copyable and fits an array. kNoCard is 0xFF, which
// cannot collide because rank 15 does not exist.
