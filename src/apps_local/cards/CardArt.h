// Drawing a playing card. Shared by every game that deals from a standard deck.
//
// Kept out of SolitaireScreens.cpp so a second card game gets the same face.
// The geometry was arrived at by looking at a panel rather than by reasoning -- see the note on the index in
// CardArt.cpp, which cost a shipped bug to learn.
//
// Freestanding in the same sense as the screen builders: it takes a
// toybox::Screen and draws, and it touches no renderer, no Activity and no
// storage, so host-tests/ui/ can run it against a fake target.
