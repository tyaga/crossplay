// Turning what Hacker News and a text extractor return into something this
// panel can draw. Freestanding on purpose: no Arduino, no renderer, no SD card,
// so host-tests/hackernews/ can drive all of it on a laptop.
//
// Two sources feed this, and they speak different dialects.
//
//   * Hacker News itself, through the Algolia API. Story and comment bodies are
//     small HTML fragments. The whole vocabulary, measured across a real thread
//     rather than guessed, is five tags (p, i, a, pre, code) and five entities
//     (&#x27; &quot; &#x2F; &gt; &lt;). That is a decoder, not a renderer.
//
//   * The linked article, through a text extractor that answers in Markdown.
//     Here the job is the opposite: decide whether what came back is prose at
//     all, and only then flatten it.
//
// The Algolia API is the one to use and the choice is not close. The official
// Firebase API needs one request per item, so a front page costs 31 round trips
// and a 57-comment thread costs 58. Algolia answers each in exactly one, with
// the comment tree already nested. On a battery-powered device over TLS that is
// the difference between a usable app and a spinner.

// --- The readability gate ------------------------------------------------
//
// Whether a page "is basically someone talking about something", which is the
// only question that decides between showing the article and showing the mark
// that says we cannot.
//
// Both numbers are measured, not chosen. Ten links from a real front page went
// through the extractor and were scored by the rule below:
//
//     PDF                    0        Twitter/X              0
//     blog post           1082        arXiv abstract      1288
//     Waymo blog          1937        news article        1983
//     SEC Form D          2787        Show HN essay      17986
//     GitHub blog        18789        ACM Queue          22028
//
// Nothing lands between 0 and 1082, so the threshold sits in a two-order-of-
// magnitude gap rather than on a slope. That is why this is a fixed number and
// not something that will need tuning: a page either has paragraphs or it does
// not, and pages without them fail by producing nothing at all.
//
// The failure modes it catches are the ones that actually occur. A PDF extracts
// to an empty body. A JS-only page (Twitter) extracts to an error sentence. A
// gallery or a download page extracts to a pile of link labels, and link labels
// are not prose because they never form a long block.

// A block has to be at least this long to count as a paragraph. Nav rows, link
// lists, captions and table cells are all shorter; the shortest real paragraph
// in the sample above was comfortably past it.
constexpr int kProseBlockMin = 200;

// And the blocks together have to reach this before we call a page readable.
constexpr int kReadableThreshold = 600;

// Sum of the lengths of Markdown blocks that read as paragraphs: at least
// kProseBlockMin long, and not a list, heading, table row or rule. Link targets
// are removed before measuring, so a paragraph is judged on its words rather
// than on the URLs hiding inside it. That matters: a short post that is mostly
// citations scored 0.69 link density and still reads fine.
int proseChars(std::string_view markdown);

// The gate itself.
inline bool readsAsProse(const std::string_view markdown) { return proseChars(markdown) >= kReadableThreshold; }

// The free half of the gate: URLs that cannot be an article no matter what
// comes back, so the list can mark them before anything is fetched and tapping
// one never spends a round trip to learn nothing. Deliberately short. A URL we
// are unsure about is fetched and judged on its content, which is the honest
// test; this list only holds the cases where fetching is certain waste.

// --- Hacker News's own text ----------------------------------------------

// Decode the entity forms HN emits: the five named ones it actually uses, plus
// &#NN; and &#xNN; numeric escapes.
//
// ALSO FOLDS. HN writes its apostrophes and quotes as numeric entities, so this
// function is where U+2019 and U+201C come into existence -- and the reading cut
// has no glyph for either, so they draw as nothing. utf8FoldTypography is
// applied on the way out. Text through here is for DISPLAY; do not point it at
// a URL or anything else that is hashed or compared.
void decodeEntities(std::string& text);

// An HN comment or text post as paragraphs of plain text, folded for display

// turn the words someone wrote into a tag this function then deletes.

// --- The extractor's answer ----------------------------------------------

// The extractor prefixes its Markdown with a header block: Title, URL Source,
// sometimes Published Time and a cache Warning, then a "Markdown Content:"
// line. Split it, because the title is worth showing and the header must not be
// scored as prose.

// --- Reading a comment tree without holding it ---------------------------
//
// Algolia answers items/<id> with the whole nested thread in one response, and
// that response is big: the largest thread on a real front page was 249KB of
// JSON carrying 146KB of comment text. Handing that to a DOM parser costs
// roughly half a megabyte to end up with the 146KB we wanted, which is the
// wrong trade on a device whose smaller target has 380KB of RAM in total.
//
// So it is scanned as it arrives off the socket and never assembled.
// HttpDownloader's chunk callback exists for exactly this.
//
// The obvious reuse, lib/JsonParser/StreamingJsonParser, does not fit: its
// token buffer is a fixed 512 bytes, and real comments run past that. A
// truncated comment is worse than a slow one, so this scanner accumulates a
// string value of any length and bounds itself where bounding is honest, on the
// total kept.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One detail decides this class's shape. Algolia serialises an item's keys in
// alphabetical order, so `children` arrives BEFORE `text`:
//
//     {"author":"pg", "children":[ ...the whole subtree... ], "text":"..."}
//
// A scanner that emitted a comment when its object closed would therefore emit
// every reply before the comment being replied to, and would not even know the
// parent's text at the time. So a comment claims its place in the output the
// moment its object opens, and its fields are filled in later, in whatever
// order they turn up. Replies land after the slot their parent already holds,
// which is depth-first thread order, which is how the thread is read.
