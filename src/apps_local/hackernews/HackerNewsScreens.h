// The Hacker News screens. Freestanding builders: a model in, a drawn frame
// out, no renderer and no Activity, so host-tests/ui/
// can assert what they drew and what they made tappable.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Three screens, and why the reader is one of them rather than two.
//
// An article and a comment thread are the same object here: a long piece of
// text, paged. They differ in where the words came from, which is the
// Activity's problem, and in nothing the screen can see. Giving them one
// builder means the page indicator, the footer and the paging arithmetic cannot
// drift between them, and a reader who has learned one has learned both.
//
// The mark for "this cannot be read here" lives on the notice screen and
// nowhere else. Putting it on a story row was the first design and it was
// wrong: the list only knows the URL, and the URL is a guess. A story whose
// link *looks* like an article but extracts to nothing would carry no mark in
// the list and then refuse to open, which teaches the reader that the mark
// means nothing. One verdict, shown at the moment it is actually known.
