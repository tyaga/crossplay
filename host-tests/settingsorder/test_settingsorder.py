    Asked of the MERGE BASE, and of its whole src/ and lib/ rather than of
    two files. Both halves of that were wrong before and each produced the
    same false verdict: a row the fork merely inherited reported as one the
    fork added, so the suite demanded upstream's own row sort below upstream's
    own rows, which cannot be done.

    THE BASE, NOT THE TIP. Ownership is a fact about our history: a row absent
    from the common ancestor and present here is ours, and nothing upstream
    does later can change that. Read off the tip instead, the answer moves
    when upstream moves -- STR_LIBRARY_REBUILD arrived in their Library view
    (their #3366, 2026-09-14), they later moved the rebuild action out of
    Settings and onto the Library screen, and the row flipped to "ours"
    without a line changing here. The base only moves when WE sync, which is
    when a re-classification is legitimate and reviewable.

    That is the mechanism behind notice n14 as well, and it is why this went
    unseen: the verdict depended on how recently the tree had fetched
    upstream. A local ref from two days earlier still had the row and the
    suite passed; CI fetches fresh every run and failed. Nothing was skipped
    and no local gate could have caught it.

    THE WHOLE TREE, NOT THE TWO SETTINGS FILES. Where upstream keeps a string
    is not a statement about who owns it; theirs lives in HomeActivity.cpp,
    LibraryListActivity.cpp and every translations yaml.
