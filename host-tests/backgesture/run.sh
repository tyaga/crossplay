# Can an app in src/apps_local ship with no way back out of it?
#
# Every app that reads Button::Back gets the left-edge back swipe for free:
#
#   MappedInputManager::wasPressed/wasReleased(Button::Back)
#     -> if (button == Button::Back && wasBackGesture()) return true;
#
# `MappedInputManager::wasSwipe()` is something else, the four-direction PAGING
# swipe: ShelfFolderActivity and hackernews compare it against Up and Down to
# turn pages. So the hole is not a missing gesture. It is an app written
# touch-only, exiting through an on-screen button, whose loop() returns early
# unless a tap arrived: a swipe is not a tap, the Back read never happens, and
# the screen has no exit. This suite is what notices.
#
#   host-tests/backgesture/run.sh
#
# TWO CHECKS.
#
# 1. Every *Activity.cpp under src/apps_local must read Button::Back from a
#    function on the PER-FRAME input path. That qualifier is the whole test: a
#    Button::Back read inside a download worker -- the "Back stops the
#    download" affordance, on a path that only exists while a multi-minute
#    fetch has blocked the loop -- passes a file-level grep and exits nothing.
#    The frame
#    path is loop(), gameLoop() (the link-play base calls it) and the route*()
#    handlers the bigger games split their screens into; that list is a
#    WHITELIST, so an app whose handler is named something new fails this suite
#    rather than slipping past it, and the fix is one line here plus a look at
#    whether the new name should exist. POSITION counts as well as presence: a
#    read below the function's "nothing to do unless a tap arrived" return is on
#    the frame path in name only, because a swipe returns before reaching it.
#    That is the same bug moved one level in, and a check that merely counted
#    frame-path functions would call it clean. Zero hits today -- no app reads
#    Back below its tap gate -- so it fires only on something newly written.
#
# 2. No app may build a back gesture out of a raw horizontal wasSwipe(). One
#    app doing that is a second, competing definition of Back that the release
#    gate, the board profiles and wasBackGesture()'s edge anchoring know nothing
#    about. Zero hits today -- the four live wasSwipe() comparisons are all Up
#    or Down -- so this fires only on something newly written.
#
# THE SCANNER RUNS ON FIXTURES FIRST, for the reason marginguard does it: a
# scanner that has quietly stopped matching anything is indistinguishable from a
# tree with nothing to match. Four shapes: an activity with Back in loop (must
# pass), one with Back only in a download worker, one with the read below the tap gate, and one rolling its
# own back out of a horizontal swipe. The last three must all be caught.
#
# What this suite CANNOT do, said plainly: it reads source. It cannot tell you
# the swipe works on the panel -- nothing on the host can, because the simulator
# does not compile lib/hal and never runs InputManager, so its swipes are a
# different mechanism entirely. It tells you every app ASKS. Whether the answer
# arrives is a device question.
#
# Nor can it see a frame on which an app asks and would not have. An app can
# return before its Back read in some state -- xkcd on an update frame, for
# one -- and a Back that lands there is dropped. That is LEFT UNPROVEN ON
# PURPOSE.
#
# The alternative was a runtime gate in ActivityManager -- do the default back
# when a Back edge existed and nothing read it -- and a cold review killed it on
# evidence rather than taste. It has counterexamples that fire on ordinary use,
# and the worst is not in an app at all: ReaderUtils.h:245 refuses the back
# gesture DELIBERATELY, returning before the button read, so that a right swipe
# can turn a page in swipe mode. Under that gate every swipe page turn would
# have closed the book. ButtonRemapActivity, which must not read Button::Back at
# all, would have closed itself halfway through a remap. "Nobody read the edge"
# detects a QUERY, not a handling, and the screens that most need to refuse Back
# are exactly the ones that refuse it by not asking.
#
# So: dropping a Back on a busy frame is benign, and the cure was worse than the
# disease. What is worth catching is an app that can never answer at all, and
# that is what this suite catches.
