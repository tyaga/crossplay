# What the release publishes, and what the docs tell people to do with it.
#
# Three separate mistakes shipped in v1.0.0 and v1.0.1, and every one of them
# was invisible to every check that existed:
#
#   1. The release published only the application image, and both README.md and
#      the site told people to `write_flash 0x0` it. On an ESP32-S3 the
#      second-stage bootloader lives at 0x0, so that writes the app over it.
#   2. Nothing published a partition table, so a first install could not work at
#      all on a device that had never run CrossPoint.
#   3. The asset was renamed to crossplay-<tag>-x4pro.bin, but the over-the-air
#      updater matches the literal "firmware.bin" and nothing else
#      (lib/JsonParser/ReleaseJsonParser.cpp). "Check for updates" therefore
#      reported no update, forever, and said nothing about why.
#
# None of that is reachable by compiling or by running the firmware, and a
# release happens rarely enough that nobody notices in time. So it is asserted
# here, against the real files rather than a description of them, in the same
# spirit as host-tests/ci.

# associates -- ESP-NOW, exactly -- is invisible to it, and it responds by
# rejoining the AP kMinBackoffMs later and dragging the radio back to the
# router channel.
#
# That shipped. Link multiplayer paired, played one move, and lost the peer ten
# seconds afterwards, on two devices sitting next to each other, because
# LinkRadio pinned channel 1 while dev mode pulled the radio to channel 9. The
# 5s backoff is the reason the FIRST move always landed: it is the width of the
# window before dev mode noticed.
#
# The rule: a file that can put the radio out of service must reason about
# Developer Mode somewhere -- pause() it, or ask holdsRadio(). That is a coarse
# bar deliberately; it does not try to prove the reasoning is right, only that
# it happened. A new file that does none of it is the case this exists to catch.
#
# DISCOVERED, not listed, for the reason spelled out in check 9.
#
# FIRST, the canaries. Three times on this branch a check stopped examining
# files and went on reporting green -- a broken process substitution, then two
# generations of comment scanner that swallowed whole files. Every time the only
# tell was the check COUNT not moving, and every time a human noticed rather
# than the suite.
#
# A COUNT floor was the obvious guard and it is worthless: measured against all
# four broken scanner generations, the taker count stayed at 7 for every one of
# them, so it caught none of the bugs it was written for. Worse, its slack was
# one file, and the affordable one was LinkRadio.cpp -- the subject of this
# entire branch could leave the check set with the floor still green. And
# consolidating two teardowns into a helper would have failed it for no reason.
#
# So: name the files that MUST be discovered. This is not the hardcoded list
# check 9 condemns -- that one REPLACED the discovery, this one WATCHES it. If a
# named file stops taking the radio, that is a deliberate change and this list
# is the right place to notice it.
# Captured ONCE, and matched with `case`, not `radio_takers | grep -q`: this
# file runs under pipefail, and grep -q exits on its first match, SIGPIPEs the
# producer and reports the pipeline as failed. That trap is documented forty
# lines above and I walked straight into it writing this.

# -- 11. every pause() has its resume(), in the same file --------------------
#
# Check 10 only proves a file says the word. This proves the pairing. Both ways
# of getting it wrong are live bugs: pause with no resume strands Developer Mode
# off the network until a reboot, and resume with no pause is the shipped
# behaviour that broke link multiplayer.
#
# Same file, because these are acquire/release around one owner's lifetime --
# LinkRadio begin()/end(), an activity's onEnter()/onExit(). A pause handed to
# another file to release is not a pattern here and should not become one
# quietly.
#
# The count has to match, not merely be non-zero. yieldDepth is a counter
# precisely so the holders can nest (the web screen yields, then opens the
# Wi-Fi picker, which yields again), and a counter is what makes an unbalanced
# pair leak instead of fail loudly.
#
# The input set is files with EITHER call. A file carrying only a resume() is
# the more dangerous half -- it releases a yield it never took, dropping the
# count out from under a holder that still has the ports -- and keying the
# search on pause() alone put exactly that case beyond this check's reach.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, said plainly: it counts source lines, not calls, and it
# cannot see REACHABILITY at all. An onExit() with an early `return` above its
# resume(), or a resume() behind an `if`, reads 1:1 here and still strands
# Developer Mode until a reboot.
# LinkRadio.cpp reads 1:1 here while end() runs three times per match, and what

# One pio run invocation for both devices, and the reason is three files away.
#
# Read this before deciding a local gate would have caught it: it could not,
# structurally. check.sh builds one environment at a time, in a tree that
# already contains the generated headers. The wipe needs a SECOND pio run in a
# tree where the first one created them -- which is a fresh checkout, i.e. CI
# and only CI. The gate was blind to the exact failure it exists to prevent,
# and stayed green through four failed releases while being blind to it. That
# is why this assertion lives here, reading the workflow text, rather than
# being left to a build that cannot reach the condition.
#
# pio run calls clean_build_dir() once per invocation against the whole
# .pio/build root, and rmtree's it when compute_project_checksum() differs from
# the stored one. That checksum covers the .h files under src/ and include/,
# and this project generates some of those during the build -- gitignored, so
# absent on a fresh checkout. A SECOND invocation therefore always wipes the
# first one's output before compiling anything. That is what emptied
# .pio/build/gh_release_x4pro/ under v1.12.14 and v1.12.15, taking firmware.bin
# and partitions.bin with the bootloader.
#
# Splitting the build back into one invocation per device restores it exactly,
# whether or not the artefacts are named in between.
# The images come from scripts_local/check.sh now, so the one-invocation rule
# moved with them, and the reason did not change: `pio run` calls
# clean_build_dir() once per INVOCATION against the whole .pio/build root and
# wipes it when compute_project_checksum() differs. This project's pre-scripts
# write gitignored headers into src/ and lib/ as the build runs, so on a fresh
# checkout invocation #2 opens by deleting invocation #1's output. That is
# what broke v1.12.14 and v1.12.15. check.sh already builds every firmware env
# in one invocation and its own comment says why; this asserts it stays that
# way, because ship.sh publishes exactly what that invocation left behind.

# Two checks lived here: that crossplay-autorelease.yml dispatched
# crossplay-release.yml only when the tag push would not start it, and the
# other direction, that the tag trigger existed at all so skipping the
# dispatch was safe. v1.12.16 was built and published twice for want of the
# first, one second apart, both exiting 0.
#
# Both read crossplay-autorelease.yml, and after that file was deleted they
# did not fail: `grep` on a missing file exits 1, `!` inverts it, and both
# took the "nothing dispatches, so nothing can double up" arm. Two checks
# passing for the wrong reason, plus a "No such file or directory" on stderr
# of every gate run. Found by a cold review, and it is the exact shape this
# suite warns about elsewhere -- a check satisfied by the ABSENCE of the
# thing it was asserting.
#
# The race is not gone, it moved to this Mac, and the assertion moved with
# it: ship.sh takes a workspace-wide mkdir lock, asserted above along with
# its crashed-holder check.

# -- the workflow that PUBLISHES must serialise against itself ----------------
#
# A concurrency group does not span workflows. crossplay-autorelease.yml carries
# `group: crossplay-release`, which reads like the release is serialised and
# serialises only the autorelease; this file -- the one that builds the images
# and uploads them to the release -- had no `concurrency:` at all.
#
# It has already gone wrong. v1.12.16 was built and published TWICE, one second
# apart: run 33884760714 on the tag push and 33884760111 on the dispatch, same
# tag, twelve minutes each, both racing to upload the same assets, and both
# exiting 0. The dispatch condition asserted above closes the
# path that caused THAT one, but it makes the collision avoidable rather than
# impossible: a hand dispatch during a tag build still overlaps, and the guard
# lives in a different file from the workflow it protects.
#
# Read out of the workflow's own top-level block, not out of any job's.
# The concurrency group became a lock directory when the publisher moved to
# this Mac. The race did not go away with GitHub -- a dozen sessions share
# this workspace and any of them can reach ship.sh -- so the assertion moved
# rather than retired. mkdir is the primitive because macOS ships no
