"""An app's own option never renders in the device's global Settings.

Mario's rule, 2026-09-05: CrossPoint owns the reader, the keyboard and the
system; a CrossPlay app's options belong inside that app.

A row under Settings > System read by exactly one app's Activity looks
deliberate and breaks that rule. Nothing sees it unless something asks WHO
READS a setting.

So this carries no list of app names, which would pass the day somebody adds an
app it has not heard of. It asks the code: for every row that renders in the
global Settings screen, find every file that reads its value. If they all live
under one src/apps_local/<app>/ directory, the setting belongs to that app and
the row must not be in the global menu at all.

A category-less SettingInfo is the intended shape for these. It still persists
under its key and is still exposed by the web settings API -- which is what lets
a setting move screens without resetting on devices that already have it -- it
simply does not render in the on-device Settings. SettingsList.h already used
that shape for the OPDS and frontlight values before this suite existed.

TWO THINGS THIS SUITE MUST NOT DO, both learned the hard way:

  It must not silently skip a row. The first version matched constructor calls
  with a regex ending `),\\n`, which missed `tiltPageTurn` -- inserted with
  `v.insert(..., SettingInfo::Enum(...));`, so its call ends `));`. That row was
  categorised, was in neither the checked set nor the disclosure list, and the
  suite reported clean over it. Calls are now brace-matched, and the parser
  ASSERTS it accounted for every `SettingInfo::` call in the file, so an
  unparsed one is a failure rather than an absence.

  It must not disclose into a void. The rows whose ownership cannot be traced
  are printed as SKIP, not as a note: check.sh surfaces `SKIP` from a passing
  suite's log and deletes that log on green, so a "note" line was written,
  never shown, then removed. host-tests/checksh polices the SKIP pattern.
