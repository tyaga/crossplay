#
# The script decides the next version and rewrites the notes block that
# host-tests/release then insists on, so a wrong answer here ships a release
# announcing the previous one, which is exactly what v1.6.2 did by hand. Every
# input the script reads is replaced: the git history, the pull requests (a
# JSON file instead of gh), the workflow file and platformio.ini.
#
# TWO FILES since 2026-09-04, and the split is the point of half of this suite:
#
#   docs/release-body.md   what a tag publishes. This release only.
#   docs/release-notes.md  the history. Every release, newest first, never
#                          published.
#
# They were one file, and so every release page carried every earlier release:
# v1.12.21's body was 20,402 characters and opened with a standing catalogue,
# then "What is new in 1.12.21", then what WAS new in 1.12.12, 1.12.11,
# 1.12.10, 1.12.9, 1.12.8 and 1.12.7.
#
# The second block is v1.12.17 rebuilt commit by commit. That release announced
# seven changes, four of which no device could see, and the one line that DID
# reach the firmware named the operation -- "Sync CrossPoint develop (6
# commits) and FreeInk SDK" -- rather than the fonts, translations and
# glyph-arena fix inside it. Mario got the update prompt on his device, read
# that version's notes, and asked why a release had happened at all. The
# fixture carries the real titles, the real sync body and the real path sets,
# because the bug was invisible to every check that existed and the only thing
# that could have caught it is the actual release it shipped in.
#
# The last block is v1.12.21 itself, from the real repository rather than a
# fixture: a release whose only device-reaching change was the version number
# the release wrote. It asserts the range does NOT warrant a release.
#
# The notes are read on the GitHub release page and nowhere else: the firmware
# parses tag_name, the asset name, its url and its size (ReleaseJsonParser.cpp)
# and draws two version numbers (OtaUpdateActivity.cpp). Checked, because the
# first version of this comment said the panel showed them.
