"""Two facts about index.html that a browser will hide from you.

A BROWSER NEVER REPORTS EITHER OF THESE. That is the whole reason they are
here: both shipped to the live page and were found by a person looking at it.

1. A card that lost its </article>. On 2026-09-01 the Trivia card was missing
   its closing tag and the Wavelength <article class="card"> that should have
   followed it, so ONE card held two shots, two tags, two headings and two
   paragraphs. .card is a flex column, so Wavelength was stacked under Trivia
   inside a single grid cell and the row went double height with a screen's
   worth of hole beside it.

   Tag counting alone does not see this: the two missing tags are a matched
   pair, so opens still equalled closes (23 = 23) and the file looked balanced.
   What gives it away is the CONTENT -- a card holding two of everything -- so
   that is what is counted here. Error recovery means the page still renders,
   and shelf_coverage.py still finds both names in the text, so nothing else in
   this suite can fail on it.

2. A shot stored at 2x. The simulator captures at twice the panel, and a
   script that copies that straight into site/assets/shots/ stores it at 2x.
   The declared width/height are the 1x numbers, so the aspect is right and
   the card looks perfect -- it is simply four times the pixels, on a page
   that lazy-loads a dozen of them.

Prints one line per problem and nothing when there are none; run.sh counts the
lines and checks the exit status.
