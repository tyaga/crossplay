# The bridge test harnesses must refuse to run against somebody else's server,
# and must not leak their own (card #286).
#
# The bug: every harness launches a server and then wait_port()s the port. That
# proves A process is listening, never that it is the one this suite started. An
# orphaned bridge from a deleted worktree held a port for four days and a suite
# spent an hour signing credentials into it, every failure reading exactly like
# the bridge refusing a password. And it orphaned because the launcher was
# killed while the socket lived on in a child.
#
# This exercises the REAL code, not a copy:
#   * server/study-bridge/tests/portguard.py -- the shared guard the CI-run
#     python harnesses import -- loaded by path and driven directly;
#   * the require_free_port function LIFTED out of sim_stack.sh by text and run
#     against a real foreign listener.
#
# The python half needs nothing installed (portguard is stdlib only), so it runs
# even in a bare checkout. The shell half needs nc (to see the listener) and
# lsof (to name it), the same tools sim_stack.sh itself uses.
