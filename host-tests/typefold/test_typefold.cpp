// What the app cuts can actually draw, and what utf8FoldTypography has to do
// about it.
//
// A glyph a font does not have draws as NOTHING. EpdFont::getGlyph returns
// nullptr, GfxRenderer skips it without advancing the pen, and there is no box
// and no fallback -- so a real Hacker News headline arrives on the panel with
// holes in it. The renderer does log it ("No glyph for codepoint N"), and
// scripts_local/sim-shot.sh even fails on that line, but only for the screens a
// scripted run reaches with real data, which is why a headline out of a live
// feed was never one of them. That
// is why this suite compiles the FONT DATA rather than describing it: a claim
// about which cut carries which codepoint is exactly the kind of claim that
// rots, and the only witness that cannot be talked round is the interval table
// itself.
//
// Three questions, and the last is the one a review cannot settle by reading:
//
//   1. Is every replacement drawable in every cut? A fold that swaps a hole for
//      a hole is worse than none, because it looks fixed.
//   2. Is every source codepoint genuinely missing somewhere? A row that folds
//      something the cuts can already draw is a silent downgrade.
//   3. What is LEFT? The gap this change does not close is asserted here on
//      purpose, so it cannot be mistaken later for an oversight and cannot be
//      quietly widened.
