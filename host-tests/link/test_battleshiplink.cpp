// A real game of battleship, played between two devices over a hostile link.
//
// Two things about battleship stress the layer, and both are asserted here
// rather than argued about:
//
//   * Hidden information. The shared state carries BOTH fleets, and a device
//     keeps the one it is arranging OUTSIDE that state until it hands it over.
//     Adopting an opponent's state is a whole-struct copy, so a fleet parked in
//     the shared state before it was sent would be silently wiped by their
//     first packet -- and the boards would still agree, which is what makes it
//     the nastiest bug available here. testYourFleetSurvivesTheirFirstPacket
//     pins it.
//   * A setup phase that the box plays simultaneously and the wire can only
//     alternate. Whoever goes first sends their fleet as their first move, the
//     other answers with theirs, and only then does anyone fire. No new
//     primitive; the test that matters is the one where a player dawdles.
