# What scripts_local/ship.sh must keep true, because it is now the only thing
# between a green gate and a public release.
#
# The GitHub pipeline used to be the second opinion: whatever a local script
# did, crossplay-release.yml rebuilt the tag and published from that. It does
# not any more, so every property that used to be guaranteed by "CI builds the
# tag" is now guaranteed by this file or by nothing.
#
# Each check below names the failure it prevents, and every one of them has
# already happened once on this repository:
#
#   1. v1.0.1 published the asset under a new name and every device's "Check
#      for updates" reported nothing, forever, because the OTA updater matches
#      the literal "firmware.bin" and nothing else.
#   2. v1.12.14 and v1.12.15 shipped with bootloader.bin, partitions.bin and
#      firmware.bin missing from the merged image.
#   3. Two agents in one evening read a red gate as a pass, once from `tail -1`
#      returning a background wrapper's "[exited with code 0]" and once from $?.
#   4. Card #572: the release brake compared RELEASE_HOLD against the literal
#      "1" while everybody was told to write "<card>:<session>:<why>", so the
#      documented format sailed through and two releases shipped under a hold.
#
# And one that has not happened yet only because the pipeline rebuilt after
# the bump: platformio.ini compiles the version into both release envs and
# OtaUpdater.cpp:119 compares a release's tag against that compiled string. A
# binary built BEFORE the bump, published under the tag AFTER it, reports the
# old version from the new firmware, so the update it just installed stays on
# offer. That is check 5, and it is an ordering check, which is the only kind
# that can catch it.

# still there, its message is still there, every text check still passes, and
# the release goes out anyway. That is the guard-shaped hole this file exists
# to close, so the checks below read the ARM rather than the mention: the
# lines between each detector and the end of its branch must reach a die.
#
# Still textual, and it does not prove reachability -- only a real publish
# does that, and a real publish is not something a suite may perform. It does
# make "noticed but did not stop" impossible to write by accident, which is
# how every one of those mutations was spelled.
# DIE_TEXT is every die() payload in the script and nothing else: from each
# `die "` to the line that closes its quote. Asking whether a guard's own
# MESSAGE is inside one is exact -- turning that die into a say removes the
# message from this set and the check fails, which is the whole point.
#
# The first version instead looked for any `die` within twelve lines of the
# detector, and two of six mutations walked straight through it by finding a
# NEIGHBOURING guard's die. A proximity test is not a test of the arm.
# DIE_TEXT is every die() payload and nothing else. Built in python rather
# than awk: the first attempt was an awk state machine that never reset, so
# once it saw one die it captured the rest of the file and two mutations
# passed against a message that was no longer in any die at all. A detector
# that over-captures is indistinguishable from one that works.

# of the firmware. Pushed earlier -- as it was until this check existed -- a
# packaging failure leaves a tag in the history with no release against it
# and a delete-and-retag to clear it.
#
# Line order is the whole assertion here, so it is read the same way as the
# bump-before-build check above.

# -- 6b. the squash goes through GitHub, and the trees are compared --------
#
# Two halves of one invariant, and neither works without the other.

# THROUGH GITHUB, because only a merge GitHub performs leaves the pull
# request MERGED with its mergeCommit set, and release_notes.py maps commits
# to pull requests by that oid and nothing else. A local squash-and-push
# leaves the pull request open with its head unreachable, the mapping empty,
# every note line falling back to a raw commit subject, and the release:minor
# label never seen -- so every release silently becomes a patch bump.
#
# AND THE TREES COMPARED, because "a squash of an up-to-date branch has the
# same tree" is true and is exactly the kind of true-by-argument the last
# defect hid behind. The images in the handover were built from the branch
# tip; if what landed differs by a byte they are the wrong bytes.
checks=$((checks + 1))
# MATCHED AS AN INVOCATION, not as the string appearing anywhere. The first

# mutation, because ship.sh's own --dry-run branch PRINTS that text: `say "
# would: gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash"`. Three checks in this file have
# now been written that way and all three could never fail. A detector

# --dry-run is deliberately NOT used: the refusals must fire before it.
# PORTABLE FORM, with the X's spelled out. `mktemp -d -t ship-suite` is BSD
# syntax: macOS appends a suffix, GNU coreutils reads the argument as the
# TEMPLATE and refuses it for having no trailing X's. On Linux it therefore
# printed nothing and exited non-zero, SCRATCH was empty, the scratch repo was
# never created, and the two refusal checks below ran ship.sh in the REAL
# checkout -- which actions/checkout leaves on a detached HEAD, so ship.sh's
# first guard refused that instead and both checks blamed the guard they were
# testing. Green on every Mac, red on every runner.
