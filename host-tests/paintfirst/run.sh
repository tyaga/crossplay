# The busy screen has to be ASKED FOR before the socket opens.
#
#   host-tests/paintfirst/run.sh
#
# THE DEFECT (card #306). Activity::requestUpdate() defaults to DEFERRED: it
# sets a flag ActivityManager::loop() consumes at its own tail, and that tail
# cannot be reached while a blocking call sits in the same call stack. So
#
#     requestUpdate();
#     fetchSomethingSlow();
#
# never notifies the render task AT ALL. The busy state is set, the busy screen
# exists and is correct, and the panel holds the PREVIOUS screen for the whole
# transfer. Two cold testers concluded the device had died; see the memory
# a-silent-screen-reads-as-a-crash.
#
# THE FIX is requestUpdate(true), which calls xTaskNotify immediately. The frame
# then RACES the socket rather than being guaranteed ahead of it. That is the
# deliberate trade: rendering is milliseconds and a network call is seconds, so
# it wins in practice, and if it ever loses the reader sees the message slightly
# late instead of never. The ask was "it doesn't feel like it crashed", not a
# guarantee -- and a guarantee (requestUpdateAndWait) costs a synchronous window
# in which a render can overlap the fetch, which is a worse bug than the one it
# fixes.
#
# WHERE A PROGRESS CALLBACK EXISTS, IT IS BETTER THAN ANY OF THIS. Get Books'
# downloadBook() survives a whole transfer because HttpDownloader's abortPoll()
# (src/network/HttpDownloader.cpp) invokes the progress callback every 50ms --
# through the connect and the headers, not just the body -- and that callback
# both repaints and pumps input. That is why Back works mid-download. Nothing
# here changes it; the sites below are the ones with no such callback.
#
# WHY A SOURCE SCAN. Which frame is on the panel when a socket opens is an ORDER
# between statements in different functions, on classes needing Storage, WiFi, a
# GfxRenderer and a FreeRTOS render task. Nothing freestanding can hold it.
#
# WHY EVERY PATTERN IS ANCHORED. A cold critic defeated the first version of
# this suite five ways: a COMMENT containing the call satisfied a grep; a
# displayBuffer() nested in an `if` satisfied a presence check; an early
# `return` above it did too; `auto lock = RenderLock(...)` evaded a check that
# grepped the spelling; and a string literal counted as code. So: comments and
# string literals are stripped properly (block comments too), every pattern
# matches a STATEMENT at an exact indent, and reachability is checked rather
# than presence.
