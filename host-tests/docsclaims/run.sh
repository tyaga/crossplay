# The claims the front-door docs make about this repository, checked against the
# repository.
#
# Three separate lies shipped here and every one of them was invisible to every
# other suite, because no suite reads prose:
#
#   1. `docs/contributing/getting-started.md` was upstream's file. It cloned
#      crosspoint-reader, it built `pio run` with no `-e`, and `[env:default]`
#      is FREEINK_DEVICE_X4/X3 -- the ESP32-C3 devices the README's one warning
#      says an S3 image used to brick. The repository's only getting-started
#      guide flashed the wrong chip from the wrong clone.
#   2. `docs/README.md` said upstream's docs stayed "untouched", naming
#      `contributing/` among them, while three files in that directory were
#      almost entirely this fork's and a fourth did not exist upstream at all.
#      That file's whole job is saying who wrote what.
#   3. `LOCAL_SCOPE.md` said "twenty-one apps, seventeen games" long after the
#      shelf passed both.
#
# Every check here DISCOVERS its expected value -- from `Shelf.cpp`, from the
# includes, from `crosspoint/develop` -- rather than holding a second copy of
# the number. A test carrying its own literal would have gone stale beside the
# doc it was guarding.
