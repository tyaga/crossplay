# check.sh's browser-artifact gate, tested against every shape it can meet.
#
# The gate is the one branch-conditional check in check.sh, and it is reached
# only on the deploy branch. That made it the rare piece of shell that runs for
# nobody: it sat switched off for its entire life under `--committed`, because a
# detached worktree has no current branch and the gate compared against one. The
# mode you reach for precisely when you are about to trust a result was the mode
# with the check missing, and nothing said so -- a gate that never fires and a
# gate that always passes read identically.
#
# So the gate gets its own test, and the test runs the gate's actual text lifted
# out of check.sh rather than a copy of it, for the same reason host-tests/ci
# lifts the CI step out of the yaml: a copy drifts, and drifts silently.

# The lock serialises device builds across worktrees because they share
# ~/.platformio, and a collision surfaces as a missing framework header naming
# no file of ours. It was acquired on x4pro and released on a hardcoded
# "sticky" -- correct until gh_release_x4pro and gh_release_sticky were appended
# to BUILD_ENVS and the release was not moved with them, leaving both release
# builds unlocked for a week. A release gate then collided with any other tree's
# device build by design, which is how it was found: WiFi.h, on 2026-08-29.
#
# So this asserts the lock is HELD DURING every env that touches ~/.platformio.
# Asserting it is merely taken and released would pass the broken code -- the
# bug was never a missing lock, it was a lock whose span stopped early.

# The build-SCOPING wiring.
#
# check.sh ran four cross-compiled builds for every change, including changes to
# site/index.html that cannot alter one byte of the result -- ten minutes,
# behind a workspace-wide lock, four times in one day.
#
# scripts_local/device-build-needed.sh owns the RULE and host-tests/gatepath
# owns its tests. What is tested HERE is the wiring: that check.sh acts on the
# answer, that it acts on it in only one direction, and that it says so.
#
# The dangerous direction is not "it built when it needn't have". It is "it
# skipped when it must not", which is silent by construction: a skipped build
# and a build that was never asked for look identical from outside. So every
# case below is written from the skip's point of view, and the fail-safe cases
# (a tool that is missing, that crashes, that is not executable) matter more
# than the happy ones -- each is a way the wiring could quietly stop asking.

# and two agents nearly shipped on a false green:
#
#   $?         A run that printed SOMETHING FAILED was observed exiting 0, and
#              `check.sh | tee out` exits with tee's status anyway.
#   tail -1    A background-task wrapper prints "[exited with code 0]" AFTER
#              this script's last line. The zero a reader acted on was the
#              WRAPPER's status. Every document in this repo said to read the
#              last line; all of them were wrong in the most common way the
#              gate is actually run.
#   tail -45   The cause had scrolled off the top while a screenful of `ok`
#              lines remained, so a red run LOOKED healthy.
#
# So the foot of check.sh is driven here exactly as an agent drives it: run it,
# capture the stream, append a wrapper line after the process is gone, and then
