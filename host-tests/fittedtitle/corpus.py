"""Emit the corpora this suite walks, DERIVED from where they really live.

Two of the five corpora cannot be reached from the test's own C++: the link
game titles are one string per game Activity header, and the xkcd titles are in
a pack on the card rather than in the repository. Everything else the test
calls directly (forehead::kCategories, toybattle::terrainAt, the dungeon guide
and Connections' own formatDate), because a corpus copied into a test is a
corpus that stops matching the app the day somebody adds a game.

    host-tests/fittedtitle/corpus.py <out.h>

The xkcd pack is looked for in $XKCD_PACK, then the workspace card, then the
emulator's small canned pack. WHICH ONE WAS USED IS COMPILED IN and printed by
the suite: a run over 32 comics and a run over 3279 are not the same evidence,
and a suite that did not say which it had would let the small one pass for the
big one.
