#
# Two things make this different from host-tests/ui, which already builds these
# same screen files:
#
#   * the DrawTarget measures with the REAL cuts (EpdFont over
#     src/apps_local/ui/fonts) and reproduces GfxRenderer's truncation, so it
#     can see a title being cut. host-tests/ui's target answers a flat ten
#     pixels a character and records whatever string it is handed, which is
#     right for layout tests and blind to this entirely.
#
#   * the corpora are COMPLETE and DERIVED, never sampled and never copied:
#     corpus.py reads the linkplay titles out of the game Activities, the
#     headlines out of the emulator's canned front page and the comic titles
#     out of the pack on the card. A corpus written into a test is a corpus
#     that stops matching the app the day somebody adds a game.
#
# No PlatformIO and no device: the screen builders are freestanding C++17 and
# EpdFont/Utf8 are too. If a builder ever reaches for GfxRenderer or the card,
# this build fails loudly rather than the check quietly becoming device-only.
