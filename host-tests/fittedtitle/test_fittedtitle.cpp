// A title must show its whole string. Asked of every real string there is.
//
// Mario's rule, given on 2026-09-05: "a tile needs to show the whole text, no
// exceptions." ToyboxFonts.h has stated the mechanism
// for it since the reading cuts were added -- "pick the largest cut it fits in,
// walking the available cuts down, and only break a word when the smallest
// still overflows" -- and until this suite there was no toybox:: function that
// did it. Six apps had written their own ladder and the rest of the fork had
// none, so a title handed to a header band was cut by the renderer instead.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR, and why it is not a list of examples: every corpus
// below is COMPLETE: every linkplay game, every Hacker News headline the
// emulator ships, and every comic title in the pack on the card. A sampled suite would
// pass on the day somebody adds the one long name -- which is precisely how
// "CURSED CEMETERY" reached a panel as "CURSED CEMETER".
//
// The instrument is real_target.h: real cuts, real EpdFont measurement, and the
// renderer's own truncation reproduced, so the question it answers is "what
// would the panel show", not "what did the builder pass".
