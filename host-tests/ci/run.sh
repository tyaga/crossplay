# THE TRIGGER INVARIANT, and it is why much of the rest of this file is now
# conditional.
#
# Until 2026-09-21 this workflow ran on every pull request and every push to
# xteink, crossplay-autorelease.yml fired on its completion, tagged, and
# pushed a version-bump commit that started it AGAIN. One change compiled four
# times from cold: ~4,955 runner-minutes over 13 days, 92 per merged pull
# request, forty minutes between a merge and the assets existing. The local
# gate already built the same two release envs, in 113 seconds against 867
# here, so all four were re-runs of a build that had already passed.
#
# The workflow is now a nightly audit and blocks nothing. ADDING A push OR
# pull_request TRIGGER BACK RESTORES THE WHOLE PIPELINE, so that is the thing
# asserted here, and it is strictly stronger than every paths-ignore check
# further down: a trigger that does not exist needs no paths to ignore.
#
# The blocks reasoning about concurrency, superseding and paths-ignore are
# kept rather than deleted and re-arm themselves the moment a blocking trigger
# reappears. Each encodes a failure that cost a night and none is
# re-derivable from the yaml.

# `cancel-in-progress: false` reads like "no run of this group is ever
# cancelled". It is not what it does. A group holds at most ONE run in progress
# and ONE run pending; cancel-in-progress decides the fate of the first. The
# second is cancelled whenever a third run arrives, either way. So the check
# above -- cancellation must be conditional on the ref -- was satisfied by a
# workflow that still lost a run per merge.
#
# MEASURED before this was written: in the 36 hours after 52d0907f made
# cancellation conditional, 41 runs of this workflow on xteink were cancelled
# and `actions/runs/<id>/jobs` returned total_count 0 for every one of them.
# None had started a job. Each was a merge whose CI reached no conclusion, and
# crossplay-autorelease.yml only fires on a run that reached success.
#
# The property that makes that impossible is not a setting, it is the GROUP:
# two commits on xteink must land in groups that cannot contend. So this
# EVALUATES the expression -- the operators GitHub's own expression syntax uses,
# over a context this supplies -- rather than reading it. A group asserted by
# grep would pass on `crossplay-ci-${{ github.ref }}`, which is the bug.
#
# And it asserts the pull-request half in the same breath, because the cheap way
# to make merges unique is to make EVERY run unique, and that silently ends
# superseding on branches -- five runs of one branch sharing the runners, which
# is what the group was added for in the first place.

# -- the autorelease gate: deleted with the workflow it tested ---------------
#
# About 390 lines and ~30 cases lived here, exercising
# crossplay-autorelease.yml's own text with a fake gh: whether a tip that had
# moved still released, whether an emulator rebuild counted as a move,
# whether an unclassified path in the gap refused rather than guessed, and
# whether a query that failed refused rather than assuming. Every one of them
# was earned. The workflow is gone (2026-09-21) and so is the whole
# release-on-a-green-CI-run mechanism they described.
#
# WHERE EACH PART WENT, because "the tests were deleted" is not the same
# claim as "the behaviour is still checked":
#
#   "does anything since the tag reach a user"  -> scripts_local/release-needed.sh,
#       which ship.sh calls and which already answers three ways (release,
#       nothing to release, REFUSED because a changed path is in no row of
#       the table). Its table is asserted by host-tests/gatepath.
#   "has the tip moved since what was verified"  -> ship.sh's fast-forward
#       guard, asserted by host-tests/ship. This is BLUNTER than what was
#       here, deliberately: the old gate reasoned about whether a move was
#       harmless (an emulator rebuild was), and ship.sh refuses any branch
#       that cannot fast-forward and asks for a rebase. That costs a rebase
#       in the case the old gate waved through, and it removes the whole
#       class of "we decided the move was harmless and were wrong". A rebase
#       is cheap now the gate is 113 seconds.
#   "one dispatch per tag, never two"  -> gone with the two paths that could
#       race. ship.sh publishes once, in one process, on this Mac.
#   RELEASE_HOLD  -> ship.sh reads it and treats ANY non-empty value as held
#       rather than the literal "1" (card #572, where the documented format
#       sailed straight through the brake). host-tests/ship asserts that.

# DORMANT WHILE THIS IS A NIGHTLY AUDIT, live again the moment a push or

# -- what the pull_request filter may and may not silence (card #547) ---------

# Mario, 2026-09-20: a documentation change should not run a pipeline. The
# filter that does that is four lines of glob in another file, and the way it
# fails is SILENT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION: a pattern one character too wide
# (`'**/*.*'`, `'src/**'` pasted in by mistake) does not break a build, it
# stops one from ever running, and a pull request that changed firmware then
# merges with no check having looked at it. Nothing else in this repository
# would notice. So the property is constructed here from sample paths rather
# than read off the file: the paths that MUST still run CI, and the ones that
# must not.
#
# The matcher below is GitHub's rule as this filter uses it: later pattern
# wins, `!` un-ignores. It is deliberately a few lines, because a test that
# reimplements a glob engine tests the reimplementation.
