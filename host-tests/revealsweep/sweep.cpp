// Reveal sweep: does the screen that REPLACES another put a different action
// under the same pixels?
//
// The failure this measures: a control produces a
// new screen, the new screen's control sits in the same rectangle, and the
// finger already resting there (or a second tap arriving during the panel's
// own 0.3-2s refresh) dismisses the thing it just asked for. The pixels are
// correct in both frames; nobody ever reads the second one.
//
// Method: build screen A and screen B against a fake draw target, route a tap
// at every point on a 4px lattice through each screen's own interaction table,
// and report the points that are live on BOTH with DIFFERENT actions. No
// device, no renderer: same freestanding build the ui suite uses.
//
// The fake text metrics (10px/char) are not the device's. Every probe is
// therefore run twice, at two different metrics; a region whose verdict changes
// between the two is reported as METRIC-DEPENDENT and must not be quoted as a
// number.
//
// THIS IS A GATE, not a report: it counts failures and prints the "N checks,
// M failed" line check.sh reads.
//
// What it fails on, and why it is shaped this way. Every collision the
// sweep can see today is already known: they are written down here, one line
// each, next to what is known about them. The gate fails when reality stops
// matching that list -- a collision that is not on it (a regression, or a new
// screen pair), or a line on the list that no longer happens (a fix landed and
// the waiver outlived it). Both directions matter: a stale waiver is a hole
// held open for the next regression.
//
// It also fails when a probe stops measuring what it says it measures. Each
// probe names the control on the FROM screen that PRODUCES the TO screen --
// the one rect a finger is provably on at the moment the panel changes. A
// probe whose producer is absent from its own fixture is a failure, not a
// blank line.
