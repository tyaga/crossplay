"""The chrome: the pages a person sees before they are anybody here.

These run without a network and without the fake service, because what they
check is what the HTML says, not what the bridge does with it.

The bug they exist for: an SVG attribute written unquoted swallows the tag's
own self-closing slash (`height="40/"`, tag never closed), so the whole figure
renders as an empty box with a caption under it. Nothing else notices. Every
suite stayed green, the login page still worked, and the only signal was
looking at it. So one of these tests parses the drawings and counts what is in
them, and another refuses an unquoted attribute anywhere in the chrome.

Run: .venv/bin/python tests/test_pages.py
