"""Refuse to test against somebody else's server, and never leak our own.

Card #286. Every harness in here launches a server and then wait_port()s for the
port to answer. That proves A process is listening, never that it is the one
this suite started. On 2026-09-05 an orphaned bridge from a deleted
worktree held port 9003 for four days, and a bridge attack suite spent an hour
signing credentials into it: every sign-in bounced, which reads exactly like a
bridge correctly refusing a password. A probe whose passing state is
indistinguishable from the symptom proves nothing.

The orphan existed at all because `python -m anki.syncserver` and uvicorn hold
the listening socket in a CHILD process. Terminate only the launcher and the
child survives, reparents to init, and keeps the port -- so the NEXT run refuses
to start, or worse, tests whatever is still sitting there.

So a harness that launches a server:
  * require_free_port() before it starts, refusing loudly (and naming the pid)
    rather than testing a stranger;
  * popen_group() to start the child in its OWN process group;
  * assert_alive() right after the wait, so a child that died during startup is
    a loud failure and not a wait that happened to find someone else's port;
  * reap() in teardown, which kills the whole GROUP, not just the launcher.

Stdlib only, on purpose: this module is imported by suites that run before their
venv is guaranteed, and it has a host-test (host-tests/portguard) that must run
with nothing installed.
