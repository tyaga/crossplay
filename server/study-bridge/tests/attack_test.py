The harness only. Every check lives in server/attacks.py; this file describes
the service to it and supplies the upstream.

Upstream is a real anki.syncserver on loopback with two throwaway accounts, so
signing in exercises the same code path a real AnkiWeb sign-in does. It never
points anywhere near a real account.
