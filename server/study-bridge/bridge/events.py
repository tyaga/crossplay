"""Post one event to the board, and never get in the way of a sync.

The contract is docs/workflow/events.md: one POST to
<SUPABASE_URL>/rest/v1/events with the public key. Where to post arrives as
SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in the environment (the pi's .env, passed
through by compose.yaml). With either missing every post is a no-op and the
service says so once in its log, at startup or at the first post, whichever
comes first.

Three rules, because the board is where numbers go and never something a
sync waits on:

- post() never raises. A prop that is not JSON, a dead network, a 4xx from
  the board: one log line, the event is dropped, the caller never knows.
- post() never blocks the caller. The request runs on its own daemon thread
  with a short timeout, so the worst case costs the process one idle thread
  for TIMEOUT_S and the sync nothing at all.
- The device field is a hash, never an identifier. A device names itself with
  the pseudonymous id in its X-CrossPlay-Device header; when it does not,
  device_id() folds the caller's id (a token hash, an account id) through
  sha256 with a fixed salt, so the board can count devices and nothing on it
  names one.

The device headers. A device never makes a request just to report; every
request it makes to a CrossPlay service carries what it has to say
(docs/workflow/events.md, "What a device sends"):

    X-CrossPlay-Device: <64 hex>          the same id on every request
    X-CrossPlay-Board:  x4pro | sticky
    X-CrossPlay-Report: {"battery_pct":N,"heap_min_kb":N,"uptime_h":N,
                         "crash":{...}, "ota":{...}}    compact JSON

and its firmware version rides in User-Agent: CrossPlay-ESP32-<version>.
client_of() reads all of it off a request without trusting any of it: an id
that is not 64 hex is no id, a board that is not a short word is no board, a
report over REPORT_MAX bytes or not a JSON object is ignored with one debug
line, and only numbers are copied out of the health fields. The usage event
the service posts anyway (a sync) then carries the device, its board and
version and the three health numbers; Client.report() posts the crash and the
update attempt the device is carrying as firmware events of their own.

Byte-identical in every bridge that reports (study-bridge, fridge-bridge).
Neither Dockerfile can COPY a file from outside its own directory without a
build change, so the module is duplicated rather than shared; each service's
tests/test_events.py checks the copies still match.
