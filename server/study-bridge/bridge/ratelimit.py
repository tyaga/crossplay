"""Rate limiting: a sliding-window counter, and a failure-driven lockout.

Its own module so it can be tested without importing the web application: the
limiter has no business needing FastAPI (or, on the study side, the deck
converter) to prove it counts correctly.

Sign-in is guarded by exponential backoff per account and a global ceiling,
not a flat per-username cap: server/attacks.py sprays fresh address/account
pairs at the service to prove it.
