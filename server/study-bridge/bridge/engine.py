"""The sync cycle: journal -> mirror -> AnkiWeb -> journal, in that order.

Everything here is blocking (pylib is synchronous); jobs.py runs it in a
thread under the user's lock. The rules, from the plan and enforced here:

- Reviews enter the mirror only from the journal, only through
  deck_to_anki.apply() (the same code the CLI has always used), only via
  pylib's own db handle -- never a second sqlite connection while the
  Collection is open (the Rust backend caches pages).
- A full sync demanded by the server is answered with DOWNLOAD, always:
  the user's AnkiWeb copy is the truth and replacing the mirror costs
  nothing, because the journal holds everything not yet pushed and is
  re-applied afterwards. UPLOAD is never chosen automatically -- if
  download is not on offer, the account freezes into needs_attention and a
  human decides.
- The journal drops reviews only after the SECOND sync (the push) came back
  clean. A crash anywhere re-runs as a safe retry.
