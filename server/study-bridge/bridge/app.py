"""The HTTP surface: a tiny human side and a smaller device side.

Human (browser, session cookie): / login page, /pair claim page, /devices
list with revoke. The session cookie is Fernet-sealed JSON (encrypt-then-
MAC, same master key discipline as the hostKeys), SameSite=Lax + HttpOnly,
and every state-changing form carries a CSRF token bound to the session --
the pairing-claim CSRF hole was critic finding A2.

Device (bearer token): pairing start/poll, deck list/choose, sync job
start/status, deck file download. The device never sees an error code, so
every refusal here is a sentence the firmware can show verbatim.

Rate limits are deliberately in-memory and crude: this process is pinned to
one worker, and the limits exist to blunt credential stuffing (A4) and
pairing-code scans (A3), not to be fair schedulers.
