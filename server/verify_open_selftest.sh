# silently matched neither sentence, or matched both, would print a confident
# verdict either way and nobody would know.
#
# So this stands up a stub that answers with each canned body in turn and
# asserts the exit code: 0 open, 1 shut, 2 cannot tell. It needs no network,
# no pi, and no credentials.
