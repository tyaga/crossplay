#   server/verify_open.sh --why    the verdict, then diagnostics from the pi
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY NOTHING ELSE ANSWERS IT
#
# Two services are gated, each by one environment variable on the pi, and
# every gate FAILS CLOSED. Every instrument we already have is blind to a shut
# gate:
#
#   docker compose up -d          exits 0 with the gate shut
#   /healthz                      answers 200 with the gate shut
#   the container's healthcheck   passes with the gate shut
#   `board pulse`                 counts books' 401 as ALIVE, which is the
#                                 exact response a stranger's reader gets when
#                                 the public credential pair is unset
#   printenv inside the container is necessary and not sufficient: it says what
#                                 the process holds, never who may sign in
#
# So the only question worth asking is the one a stranger asks, and the answer
# lives in the response BODY rather than the status code. The bridge answers
# 200 whether it lets you in or refuses you.
#
# THE TWO SENTENCES, AND THEY MEAN OPPOSITE THINGS
#
#   "This bridge is invitation-only for now."
#       OUR gate refused. The door is shut. Nobody but the allowlist gets in.
#
#   "AnkiWeb did not accept that email and password."
#       Our gate let the attempt THROUGH and the upstream refused the
#       credential. The door is open and this probe's key is wrong, which is
#       the whole point: the key is deliberately bogus.
#
# A careless reader sees two sign-in failures and calls both "still broken".
# They are opposite verdicts. That confusion is the reason this file is a
# script and not a paragraph in a runbook.
#
# COST: one bogus sign-in per run. LOGIN_IP is 5 per 5 minutes per
# address, so about five runs per five minutes before this probe rate-limits
# itself. The usernames are fresh and end in .invalid (RFC 2606), which can
# never be a registrable domain, so no real person's account is ever touched
# and no failure is ever recorded against one.
