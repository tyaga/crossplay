# Shaped after study-bridge's. Two things it does that are not obvious:
#
#   * chowns the bind mount through a THROWAWAY CONTAINER rather than with a
#     local chown. The deploying user is not root on the box, so a plain chown
#     fails silently and the service then 500s on its first write with
#     "Permission denied: /data/fridges" -- which is how this was first
#     deployed.
#   * stamps BUILD with the git short sha, so the running service can be asked
#     what it is. A fix that is merged and not deployed looks exactly like a
#     fix that does not work.

#
# THROUGH THE CONTAINER, not through a host port. This asked 127.0.0.1:8098 and
# that port has never existed: compose only EXPOSES 8080 on the private network,
# where the cloudflared sidecar reaches it, and publishes nothing to the host.
# So every deploy this service has ever had ended in "WARNING: /healthz did not
# answer" over a service that was answering perfectly well, which is worse than
# no check at all -- a warning that is always there is a warning nobody reads.
#
# AND IT ANSWERS WITH THE SHA IT IS RUNNING, which is the question worth
# asking: `docker compose up -d --build` prints "Container Running" when it
# decided nothing needed recreating, and that is indistinguishable from a
# rebuild. Compared against the sha this script just stamped, so a deploy that
# did not take says so instead of looking identical to one that did.
