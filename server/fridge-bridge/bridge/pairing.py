"""Pairing: the reader shows a code, a browser claims it, the reader collects
its token.

Shaped after server/study-bridge/bridge/pairing.py, with two deliberate
departures.

SIX DIGITS, NOT EIGHT LETTERS. The study bridge shows an 8-character
code because it is scanned off a QR or typed by the person holding the device.
This one is read down a TELEPHONE to somebody in another country -- that is the
entire reason Live uses a code rather than a QR, because a QR can only be
scanned by someone already holding the reader, and the day the Wi-Fi changes
that person is on another continent. Digits survive being spoken; "J" and "K"
do not.

Six digits is a million, not a trillion, so the guessing is held off by the
attempt caps here rather than by the size of the space: a code dies after
WRONG_GUESSES_PER_CODE wrong answers, and app.py rate-limits claims per address
and globally. A code also dies at CODE_TTL_S, and is single-use.

NO ACCOUNT CLAIMS IT. The other bridges require a signed-in user because they
hold that user's upstream credentials. A fridge holds a picture, and asking
somebody's mother to make an account to be sent one is the friction this
feature exists to remove. The claimer gets an opaque sender token in a cookie
instead, and the reader can revoke any sender.
