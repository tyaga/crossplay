"""fridge.ma-r-s.com -- Live, the API and nothing else.

Somebody draws a note on their phone; a reader asleep on a fridge in another
country shows it in the morning. This service is the only thing between them.

NO PAGE LIVES HERE. What people open is crossplay.ma-r-s.com/live/, part of the
CrossPlay site and set in its stylesheet, its bar and its type. This host served
both for a while and the page was a design orphan: it shared nothing with the
site and drifted further every time the site changed.

TWO HOSTS, ONE REGISTRABLE DOMAIN, which is what makes the split safe rather
than merely tidy. The sender cookie is scoped to `.ma-r-s.com`, so it is
FIRST-party for both names and Safari's third-party cookie blocking -- which
would otherwise end this on an iPhone -- never applies to it. SameSite is
decided by site and not by origin, so Lax is still delivered on an XHR from one
subdomain to the other. See claim() for both, and CORS below for who may ask.

THE READER IS ASLEEP AND UNREACHABLE. Nothing here ever pushes, polls or opens
a connection to a device: deep sleep drops the radio and the USB, so a sleeping
reader cannot be asked anything at all. It wakes on its own schedule, makes one
request, and goes back down. Everything this service knows about a reader it
learned the last time the reader spoke.

ONE ROUND TRIP PER WAKE. /api/pull answers "is there anything new" and "when
should I wake next" together, and answers 304 when the answer is no. A wake
that finds nothing spends a few kilobytes and no SD write and no repaint. The
one fact only the reader has -- whether Live is still on -- rides that same
request as a header rather than a second call, so the count stays at one. The
only extra call a reader ever makes is POST /api/off, and that one happens
when somebody switches Live off, never on a wake.

Host must be exactly one label below the apex: Cloudflare's Universal SSL on
the free plan covers ma-r-s.com and *.ma-r-s.com and nothing deeper, and the
reader's baked root bundle carries the chain that edge serves.
