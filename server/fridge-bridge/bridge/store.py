        `wake_in` is SECONDS FROM NOW, converted here to this service's clock.
        Never an absolute time from the reader: its only clock comes from
        X-Server-Time, and a device whose battery went flat comes back at the

        check-in, by construction rather than by a second write somewhere else.

        The check-in counter costs no extra write: this method already saves. A
