"""Break a bridge on purpose, so its attack suite can be watched going red.

A check that has never failed is not a check. This repository has shipped two
gates that could not fail and spent a night removing them; adding a third would
be worse than adding none. So every check in attacks.py has a weakening here
that must make it red, and running the matrix (server/verify_attacks.sh) is how
that stays true rather than remaining a claim in a commit message.

The weakenings are applied to the imported module at runtime, never to the file
on disk. Nothing here can escape the test process, and a weakening that fails to
apply is an error rather than a silent no-op -- otherwise "the check went green
under the weakening" would be indistinguishable from "the weakening did
nothing", which is the same failure the checks themselves exist to prevent.

Each entry names the checks it must redden. verify_attacks.sh asserts exactly
that, both ways: the named checks go red, and the run without a weakening is
green.
