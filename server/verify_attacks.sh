#
# The suite in attacks.py is only worth running if its checks CAN fail. This
# script proves that they can, one weakening at a time: for each entry in
# server/weaken.py it breaks the service on purpose, runs the suite, and
# asserts that exactly the checks that weakening claims to cover went red.
# Then it runs the suite unweakened and requires it to be green.
#
# Two directions, and both matter. A check that stays green under its own
# weakening does not work. A check that goes red under a weakening it does not
# claim is either mislabelled or coupled to something it should not be, and
# either way the map from "this went red" to "this is broken" is wrong -- which
# is the only thing an attack suite is for.
#
# This is not part of deploying (deploy runs attack_test.py itself). It is what
# you run when you ADD or CHANGE a check, and it is the reason the suite is
# allowed to gate a deploy at all.
