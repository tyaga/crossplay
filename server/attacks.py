"""The attacks an outsider would actually run, as a suite that fails a deploy.

The bridge is open to the world and its source is public: the rate limits,
the code alphabet, the lockout windows and the token lifetimes are all
readable by whoever is attacking them. Security therefore cannot rest on any
of them being unknown, and this file is how that is checked rather than
asserted. It is the sibling of scripts/isolation_test.sh -- the precedent that
a claim about safety which nothing runs is not a claim -- and it is wired into
the deploy script for the same reason.

What a check needs to know about the service is described by the Service
profile below and nothing else, so the checks themselves name no endpoint.

The suite runs against the service's real ASGI app, over its real HTTP surface,
with a real fake upstream behind it. It does not import the limiters and ask
them questions; it asks the service.

Two ways to run it, and only the first proves anything about the CODE:

  hermetic (tests/attack_test.py, no arguments) -- a throwaway data directory
      and a fake upstream. Every check runs, including the floods. This is
      what gates a deploy.
  live (tests/attack_test.py --base https://...) -- against a deployed
      service. Only the checks that are SAFE against production run: nothing
      that floods a shared rate limiter, locks a real account out, or writes.
      Which checks those are is a property of the check (safe_live), not a
      flag at the call site, so the list cannot rot.

Adding a check: write it, then WATCH IT GO RED. weaken.py exists so that the
checks which pass today can be seen failing against a service broken on
purpose. A check that has never been red is a check that does not work; this
repository has already shipped two of those.
